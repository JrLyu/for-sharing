Robinhood Financial LLC 85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

Edit: Fellow Regarded, please buy more GME and Hold 💎🤚🏾 the rewards helps with visibility but it’s better spent there.

Edit 2: 
I’m getting a lot of questions regarding the same things so I’ll try my best to answer them. 
- For FINRA online complaint, scroll down to the section reading “Problems addressed by FINRA” under it click the Orange button that reads “FILE ONLINE COMPLAINT” 
- FINRA CRD NUMBER: 165998 [ Thanks u/Mattcwh ]
- User [R] pointed out that Robinhood is owned by Citedal, a hedge fund that along side with Point72 injected ~$3B into Melvin. Standing to lose a shitton of money to us degenerates. This further points out why Robinhood  is trying to manipulate the market to help out the suits at Wall St. 
- Lots of questions concerning the Security type. If it’s for GME you put it under CLASS A OR D Securities.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the people who filed what they could."
1,"I am in. I have photos documenting inability to trade in GME and AMC positions with time stamps and will submit these as proof.

~~I am also in the process of now switching brokers to webull~~

Edit 3: I believe we gave the SEC the hug of death. Document anything you planned on uploading, and file your complaint in a few hours

Edit 5 and cleanup edit: At this moment, I am continuing to get mixed reporting on abilities to trade in stocks on multilpe platforms. At this time, it appears generally Fidelity and Vangaurd are working, if they are not it is most likely a server issue due to increased load and traffic. At this time it appears that **ONLY** Robinhood has blatantly blocked the ability to trade. *But, I have heard mixed reporting on inabilities to trade on other platforms.*

Edit 6: tastyworks has removed trade restrictions.

I appreciate everyone providing me updates on this, and I will do my best to continue to provide up-to-date accurate information.

**FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE SEC OVER MARKET MANIPULATION BEING DONE BY ROBINHOOD!** it only takes a few minutes, if the form is not working try again later, it may have been given the hug of death.

5,"A lot of people don’t know this but this is EXTREMELY important. 

Robinhood makes about [half of its revenue](https://fortune.com/2020/07/08/robinhood-makes-millions-selling-your-stock-trades-is-that-so-wrong/) from flow through to the MASSIVE hedge fund Citadel Securities. 

Citadel is also the firm that has been [funding Melvin capital ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340)(the firm who started the shorts in the first place) in the last few days, in the billions, to help them cover shorts. Yesterday rumors started that Melvin was continuing to buy more shorts, I knew they were about to change the rules. Both firms stand to lose a lot of money from this, or walk out with one of the most brazen robberies in history. 

Best part? The founder of Melvin capital, [Gabe Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvin_Capital), worked for Citadel when he founded Melvin. (Fun fact, Plotkin was just in the news last month for buying two new homes in Miami Beach for $45 million!)

They are about to rob the American people of billions and have been colluding in the highest level and blatant market manipulation. They figured they’ll pay a few million in fines, if that, and make billions off of the people. 



Fuck Gabe Plotkin, Melvin capital, Citadel, and Robinhood."

For anyone that didn't know, The Mark Cuban Foundation established the Fallen Patriot Fund to assist the families of fallen warriors and those seriously injured in the line of duty. To this day they have issued out over $5 million in grants.

16,"**How Margin accounts help shorters:**

If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.

Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.

Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.

18,">If i borrow a stock from you to short, and when I short it and your buddy buys it, then they can loan it to someone else to short

I finally get it now:

* A loans 1 share to B
* B short sells it to C
* C then loans the share out to D
* D also short sells it

Even though only 1 share is involved the short interest is now 2 because D owes C 1 share, and B owes A 1 share. D could buy and close the short with C, now C has a share that B could buy and close with A and the whole thing is unwound.

Only problem is D sold the share to WSB... and WE AREN'T SELLING!!! 💎🙌"

Mark -

We're doing something similar with the Locum Project started in 2018; we identified an inefficiency in the market and found a way to cut out that inefficiency (unnecessary middle-men) which is whacking companies for 30-40% margins over actual cost, for no good reason other than it's been the ""protocol"" for the last 40 years. We forward part of that savings to those actually doing the work, return the rest of the money to the company using them - and run the entire thing through a secure portal using a block-chain type technology. Our goal is to destroy a $58B a year industry in North America and put millions of middlemen out of work, thus creating a more competitive, efficient market - least that's how we pitched it to our legal team at Perkins Coie.

A lot of times it's just about looking around at what's going on, using your experience and identifying better ways of doing things."
23,"The brand value they’ve got from being in the news is real. They have a real website that sells real goods (even though they fucked me on Pokémon cards I wanted). In store has struggled due to covid...more so in some states, but they are positioned for a resurgence as things open. The US is one of the top 5 countries in terms of vaccinated populations...and things are only going to accelerate. A lot of people got hit hard by covid and are poor but need an escape. The 2nd hand game market is only going to grow.

People flush with cash who weathered covid well may want to build the game collections they always wanted as a kid...

There is real value in GameStop. But not the kind that would be reflected by a short squeeze spike...take profit on the upslope (make sure you don’t miss the peak) and then buy back in when prices stabilize"
24,A deep **fucking** value play
25,"A ***Deep Fucking Value*** play, to be specific."
26,A smart business move for them would be to make it *really* easy to buy and sell used games through their website. That would incentivize people to actually start doing that again
27,"Well, it really can be explained by laziness. Here's the problem: even though WSB wasn't on silver, the front page was still 95% about silver. Sure, every post was ""SLV IS A LIE DON'T BUY SLV."" But every post is also ""I'm a smooth brained retard and I don't even know what I said here I just punched my keyboard with a butterball turkey until it looked like English.""

Journalists don't want to take the time to figure out if SLV is really a lie or if you're talking in doublespeak to avoid a securities law. But what they do know is their 50 sources called in and said SLV is the push (this was the tactic Cramer cited in his infamous 2006 interview). It's easier to take the source's word for it than to dig in and understand the community at a deeper level."
28,"Party A has 4 shares at $10 

Party B [hedge funds in this case] thinks the share price will drop to $5 so they borrow those 4 shares from Party A and sell them to Party C at $10 per share ($40 total), hoping they will be able to buy back those 4 shares when the price goes down to $5. This would give them a 50% profit because ($40 selling gain - $20 of shares bought back and returned to Party A) 

Party C is now in possession of 4 shares 

Party D also thinks the share price will drop to $5 so they borrow the 4 shares from Party C and also sell those 4 shares to party E for $10 each (same situation as A and B are in) 

So now we have 8 shares that have been sold in total out of the 4 actual existing shares. This represents a short interest of 200%. 

Party D now has to buy back 4 shares from Party E in order to give them back to party C. Once that's done, Party B can buy 4 shares from Party C to give back to party A so that the whole thing can be unwound. 

BUT - if party E finds out about all this and holds the stock then party D can't pay back party C , and party B can't pay back Party A. 

Once we reach a certain point in time, party A and party C are both owed their shares back from B and D respectively. But because E is hanging on to those shares they can't return those shares. The only way to return them is to buy more shares, which will either be WAY higher price by now resulting in unfathomable losses, or be unavailable to buy entirely which if I understand correctly would skyrocket the stock price because there is not enough supply.  

This is my understanding. Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm just a dumb fucking retard on the internet who doesn't know shit about fuck"

30,"A short ladder is just sleight of hand, it doesn’t change anything in the real world.  

Eventually those shorts will come due and they’ll need to buy the stock to cover it.  Which you can’t do when you are shorting over 100%.  Which is why you don’t do that, lol.

Just hold, ape."
31,"A) The order flow is public. You can scoop shares on the cheap as they bounce around the hedge funds. In effect, they're bleeding what few shares they do have to force the price down, and you're buying at a discount when this happens. 

B) To cover, they would need willing sellers at that low price. There may be people dropping out of the race at certain price levels, and their shares are up for grabs. Otherwise, they're stuck with their shares bouncing around, which is far from enough in volume to close out any short position."
32,"Assets and things like that pretty much always end up being bought more in times like this, because it's basically the easiest way to hedge against inflation/hyperinflation.

35,"If we take that valuation of $5b and divide it by the outstanding shares (70mil) you get ~$71.00 per share. A rough kinda estimate at what shares should have been.

Its clear that the $5 per share last year was manipulation caused by the hedge funds pushing it down. And seeing how most of them are shorted in positions lower than $60 it'll be impossible to push it down if we hold out and don't sell."
36,"2007 and 2008 destroyed my parents' livelihoods. We barely held on to our house, thanks to borrowed money from my extended family. Went to food shelves, sold sentimental items to pay the bills, my parents drained what they'd saved for my college fund. I was 10 years old, crying all the time, developing anxiety disorders because of the upheaval. To this day I hoard food and household items compulsively even with three steady paychecks coming into my household. I'm still not rich, I'm a lunchlady with 1 share of GME hoping to pay off some student loans with my gains and give some money to a friend who needs dental work done.

37,Nice essay A+
38,"I was little when the recession hit, but I remember bits and pieces. I remember my grandparents losing their car dealerships, my dad losing his job at said dealerships, my Mom returning to work as a teacher. I didn't know the extent to how bad things were until recent years. I remember one day in freshman year of high school, I was having a mental and emotional breakdown. My dad leveled with me in a way he never had before. He admitted to me that when we lost the dealerships, he went on unemployment, and things were getting pretty bad. He admitted to me (something I don't even think he told my mother) that he was extremely close to just getting into a ""car accident"" and supporting us with his life insurance.

I've had the fortune of not actually seeing him in that state, and I intend to keep it that way. I'm not a tankie or anything, I fully believe in and support capitalism, but I genuinely hope these mushroom dick bankers and pig fuckers on Wall Street choke on my testicles. I don't like to believe that people in this world are cartoonishly evil, but I know these knob-slobbering chodes have absolutely no problem demolishing the lives of millions just so they can get another yacht.

And I really hope this is it, I really hope this is the beginning of a takedown of these predatory miscreants. I pray that this isn't just some blip in history where a bunch of assholes on the internet made a mess of things. This will be a revolution in which the masses reap their rewards. Not from violence and riots, not from meaningless protests that make school kids think they're revolutionaries, not from the government making taxes and legislation, but from *SHEER. UNADULTERATED. AUTISM.* WE'LL TAKE BACK WHATS OURS BY TAKING THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE FREE MARKET, MAKING IT INTO A FIST, AND SHOVING UP THEIR ASS! SORRY MR.

Don’t you think all this retail investing and volume will go away once we all are really shown behind the curtain just how rigged the game is. 

CNBC proved yesterday and today that we have a rigged stock market. They did this though not by telling us; but by showing us in the way in which they behaved live on air; Andrew Ross Sorkin’s vagina aching; speaking down, or talking down, to us like we are all peasants. 

Fuck that. 

Fuck them.

If they think they can just move goal post & cheat and get away with it like a rigged election, not this time. Not with my $GME calls. 

Now when for once in American History, David has proven he can defeat Goliath.

COMPLAINT:

Robinhood financial LLC willfully engaged in market manipulation by restricting buying power of the security GME and preventing its users from exercising their financial leverage to cover their position. This has resulted in immeasurable losses to millions of users unable to trade the security in a way that is financially in their best interest according to their own belief.

Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security."

It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community.

C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.

84,"A split adds more volume to the stock and effectively lowers the entry price per share. It’s a common business tactic, this year when Apple was around the $450 mark they did a 4:1 split, so if you owned 1 share at $450 you now own 4 shares at ~$112/share. This allows more people to buy in and typically results in an increase of the price per share as people try to get in at the lower price point."
85,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w4anTIL57mE

If you all were not aware on February 2nd 2021 Blackrock Inc purchased 6.2 million shares and spent over 65 million dollars in AMC with a 5.6% stake in the company. This is very good news. Yes we took losses the last 2 days as expected that is because of these hedge fund ladder attacks. They are so desperate they are putting everything in their arsenal to drag down the price to put fear in AMC stock holders to sell. A lot of you fell for it!!! Just like a lot of you fell for it with GME. Mark Cuban Billionaire told us to hold!!!! Robinhood is now allowing 1,250 shares of amc. Get multiple brokers and consume and purchase and hold as much amc as you can we are about to take off... if you don’t get in on this opportunity right now you will miss out on these discounted prices of AMC and GME. It was very important for us to hold the line. We can’t let them win. They are very desperate right now. With the legal lawsuits with robinhood they are now tied down.... this is in our favor!!! The squeeze can happen now if we all work together... trust me on this! The patterns are similar to the GME and Volkswagen in 08 pattern.... please hold just trust me on this! If you want to change your families life forever stay according to the plan BUY and HOLD! Our turn is about to come, they are bleeding money these hedge funds."
86,SERIOUSLY BUY AND HOLD. This is the dip they are trying to manifest before they buy in to cover shorts at lower price. IT WILL BE A FRENZY OF BUYING at some point. Look at a current one month chart in GME compared to VOLKSWAGEN SQUEEZE. This is the dip before the frenzy

91,"I don't know whether this applies directly to this GME case, but it could be an advantage of the hedge funds' low latency for High Frequency Trading (HFT). The computers of the hedge funds that run the algorithms (HFT) are installed inside the exchange's building to execute trade orders as fast as possible. The servers of these computers are co-located right within the exchange to get the lowest possible latency. A lower latency equals faster (trade) order execution, which the hedge funds can benefit from. The hedge funds pay the exchanges for these spots. It's basically impossible for a retailer to be faster than these bots because the hedge funds' orders are executed faster."

101,"Here's how I modified the post:

This morning I, and countless other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without prior notice. Selling was still allowed. This clear example of market manipulation forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 before market open.

To argue that this is to ""protect retail investors"" is absurd. We are already required to acknowledge the inherent risk in the market before purchasing securities. This may have been done to protect people, but it was not the retail investors. A door that only swings one way for retail investors is not a protection, it's attempted incitement of a panic. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price."
102,"For the SEC ""Tell Us About Your Complaint"" I put this:

Robinhood Financial LLC has manipulated GAMESTOP CORP NEW CL A stock Ticker symbol: GME. They have done this by prohibiting the ability to buy the stock yet not the ability to sell. This violates Rule 144 of the SEC because it is a manipulation of the stocks Volume. 

Robinhood has ties to hedge funds invested in shorting GME. They sell data to Citadel LLC who has recently bailed out Melvin Capital Management LP who was heavily shorting the stock. This is a conflict of Interest. Please look into how Melvin Capital was able to short GME 140% of the shares outstanding thereby depressing GME's Market Cap below its cash value. Look into the loan by Citadel. Look into Robinhood's ties to Citadel and Melvin capital.

Thank you for your time."

104,"So let me ask from the profit-related side of things, because I want to see these guys get fucked just as much as the next ape, but I also want those tendies: will there or won’t there be a true short squeeze if these hedges are found to have essentially counterfeited $GME stocks? I mean, do people still get paid for their shares? Does the squeeze never happen, as they slowly cover their shorts with fake shares over time? What’s the endgame here aside from the hedges (hopefully) getting fucked by the SEC and (hopefully) going to prison? I can’t buy Lambos with morality feel-good points. Do we see $1k/share from this?

I hate to say it boys and girls, but this situation feels like a shell of what it was 2-3 weeks ago. I think the squeeze got too much attention and the suits had time to coordinate and react. I’m not saying a squeeze won’t happen, but I think the lengths they’ll go to in order to prevent it are much greater than anticipated. I actually take the news of Robinhood’s loosening of buying restrictions as a bad sign. I feel like a lot of shorts have covered. Just my opinion. Hope I’m wrong. The billboards were a neat thing though. I’m still going to hold the shares I have left, because it is nice being a part of this. But I feel that the biggest gains have been gotten.

EDIT: I’ve gotten THREE replies on this comment and each time I go to view/read them they’re gone. I don’t know what’s going on, but this sub has become so fucking impossible to follow.

Edit 2: Four comments deleted.

105,"While you aren't wrong, it doesn't matter.

Yes, super duper shady shit just transpired in broad daylight.

The reality of the matter is there is probably 10's of millions of counterfeit shares (or artifact shares depending on your point of view) that have been created along the way. The early shorts most likely used these to exit. New shorts have been piling in as this ramped up way too quickly, and have made an absolute fortune. With the option chain continually getting bumped up, there was no shortage of room for a MM to generate a naked call, sell to a hedge (not through the market, directly), and use that to ""close out"" the short position.

They restricted buying so there was no liquidity run. They know the numbers held by retail, which were borrowable and which weren't. They also knew how many they could borrow from institutions or get them to pop free if need be. Once momentum had been blunted and the gamma squeeze prevented, now it became a game of emotionally wear down retail. They knew exactly where we stood Friday and where they did, and they moved with asymmetric knowledge. Retail was stymied longer than necessary, but now is done just to keep a safety valve on it. The option chain is too large now to get a gamma squeeze, so that risk is off the table.

I think they've abandoned plan A of short GME into bankruptcy and now are in the mode of make some profit and get out of the play and leave the evidence so murky and obfuscated that it would take a smart and dedicated investigator (which there aren't any) and a massive amount of congressional pressure changing laws to force the information to rise. And even then, most of the trail will be punted offshore through multiple channels to make it almost impossible.

The only real hope for change on this, is that a whistleblower from one of the hedge funds comes forward (and I wouldn't count on this)."

They say contact them to downgrade, but the page is 404’d out, I think this is the true reason why RH didn’t shut down margin and chose to restrict share purchases. They need to keep loaning our shares to the shorts. The shorts NEED shares from RH to fund their attack. Crazy how much they screw us.

Edit: This seems to be the form that we have to use to turn into a cash account. They make it extremely difficult to turn this off. This is the way. [https://robinhood.com/contact](https://robinhood.com/contact)"

111,But it’s not a squeeze. silver is going up as predicted in 2021 because of the sliding dollar....and in these market conditions it makes sense the silver could go up a few bucks. I don’t think anyone preaching squeeze is being truthful....but also NOT EVERY FUCKING THING IS A SQUEEZE.

114,"This is obviously what is going on right now.  


1) WSB was a  genuinely grassroots movement which found out how to crowd-short-squeeze  hedge-funds and banks. They did this with GME.  


2) Then the  silver squeeze, as being the ultimate short-squeeze, was a logical  progression of this. GME was short 150%, but silver is short 50,000%. It  gained traction. Both the left and the right were united.  


3) The original WSB silver thread said to buy PSLV and AG and physical and avoid SLV, but the mods censored it.  


4) A new thread was then created shilling SLV and attacking PSLV and AG; mods left it up.  


5) ""Citadel fud"" begins when people show that Citadel is long SLV, which is completely irrelevant.  


6) Whole of WSB starts attacking silver, nothing but anti-silver threads on the front page.  


The plan:  


7)  GME falls apart, short-squeeze community is bitterly divided, silver is  given the blame, kills momentum in the silver short squeeze as well.  


Don't let the bankers win. Keep buying silver."
115,"Posts like this are helping the narrative, though. In fact, pretty much the entire WSB front page is some variation of ""SLV IS A LIE."" Few top posts directly reference any other stock discussions.

Which means viewers of this sub may see you say ""SLV IS A LIE,"" but they're still going to be left with SLV in their head because it's all the forum is talking about, even if the way it's being talked about is not the way these organizations are claiming."

121,"Alright fam, here’s my thoughts (disclosure, I’m a retard, but I’ve got a few wrinkles, a JD, and some basic addition and subtraction skills):

* GME float is roughly 47M shares. (For the retardeder folks, this is the number of shares available for trading).

* The number of shares short is still above 68M. 

* The number of shares held by institutions is 122% of the total number of shares, or 86.62M shares. 

* This is 155% of the float. 

* But, how many shares do retail investors hold? (How many shares can be traded if we fucking keep holding?)

A number was released today that 50% of Robinhood users held GME. That’s roughly 6.5M users. And, that’s only RH users. Let’s extrapolate across other brokers, our euro bros, our Asian bros, and our bros from down under, and call it an even 8M users. (Might be low). 

If we make the assumption that each retail holder has 1 share, that’s 8M shares. Or, 17% of the float. If the average user has 3 shares, that’s 24M shares, or 51% of the float. If it’s 5 shares, that’s 85% of the float. I don’t know what the numbers are, but you get the idea. 

What does this mean? It means we have the power. If you compare to the VW squeeze, we are Porsche. But, we have help. There are some others (not Burry) who are holding 1M+ positions, those cut into the float also. 

That means that eventually, to close their short positions, the short holders MUST buy retail’s shares. They have to have your bananas. 

And, failing to close the short will continue to cost them. They have to keep paying the longer they hold the short. They are renting the share. And, eventually, the bean counters will decide that the market price is better than the rent. That’s the squeeze. 

Don’t fucking sell. We know that apes are stronger together, but recognize what a huge portion of this stock we control. We are, together, the largest holder of GME. And!!!! We have no margin. We have no risk. We have no ongoing expense of ownership. The market made sure of that. So, let their actions slit their own throats. 

Don’t sell.  If you do, buy back in. Don’t let up. 

And, don’t forget, I’m an idiot. You probably shouldn’t listen to anything I say.

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

136,"APES READ THIS

The squeeze probably will NOT happen today. All we will see is options expiring. This will drive the price up. DON'T BE FOOLED THOUGH. This won't be the real squeeze yet! That will probably happen next week.

THEY WILL RELEASE A PRESS STATEMENT AT 9AM, IT WILL ALL BE LIES, DONT BE FOOLED BY IT. DONT LISTEN TO THE MEDIA. HOLD YOUR FUCKING GROUND.

On top of this there will be HUGE SHORT LADDER attacks all throughout the day. DONT BE FOOLED, there is no fucking volume and like yesterday, nobody will be selling!

We will take them for EVERYTHING they have and more. Their bunruptcy is cover by insurance firms, who are also covered until infinity. We will get our money one way or the other!

Im not a financial advisor, just a retard.

DONT UNDERESTIMATE YOUR WILL POWER.

139,"  

I will try to keep this brief. 

I have never been so proud of the world as I am during this movement. You guys and gals coming in clutch from Germany, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Brazil, and I’m sure many more, thank you. Of course the monetary gains for the 99% are part of it, but at this point I am just so happy that as a world we rose up and are making these scumbags burn. 

I am 24, with another 60k USD in student loans, and another 120k USD-ish in student loans for the fiancé (honestly too scared to look to know for sure). I have a good job, good growth potential, sure. But I grew up poor, and as long as these loans hover over us we still will be negative net worth for at least a decade. I worked all through college, I joined the army guard during sophomore year to pay for some of it, was drilling, working, and studying, overloading my course schedule so I can graduate on my planned date. 

It brings me such joy seeing the worldwide masses supporting the cause, not even for the money but to make a point and change the system. 

A wise man once said, 

People can no longer cover their eyes  
 If this disturbs you then walk away  
 You will remember the night you were struck by the sight of  
 Ten thousand fists in the air

Except this is not ten thousand fists, this is millions of fists all in the air at once, all across the globe. 

You are amazing, and thank you. We will make them pay for fucking us for so long."

One of the ways they rig the game is order flow. Hedge funds pay for your orders so their high frequency trading algorithms can adjust accordingly, maximizing the amount of money they steal from you. 

The reason they are so pissed off is because we are HOLDING. There is NO order flow other than $10,000 sell limits. They have no idea what to do because the data they pay for isn’t there. They can try to run algorithms on Reddit, but our information is too delayed. When I BUY and post ‘bought more’ it’s too late for the algorithm to make a decision. When I HOLD, the algorithm breaks down because it flashes some insane amount of loss when they have to cover their short positions since there’s no order flow. 

Yesterday was their attempt to find another way to rig the game because they’ve completely lost control of the thing that’s been used to steal money for years. 

THIS IS NOT MY FUCKING PROBLEM, I LIKE THE STOCK AND IF YOU GO BANKRUPT TRYING TO ROB ME, MAYBE ITS TIME FOR A NEW CAREER. 

BUY AND HOLD."

147,"I hear a lot of people claiming that what's happening here with GME is some sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.

On Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the ""BUY"" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.

What happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!

Because these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.

They know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.
WE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.

On Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's ""too risky"", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.

They know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.

THAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand. We could see the stock rise to $1,000 a share, only too plummet to $5 in a matter of minutes, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA SELL SHIT!!!

We're living in a timeline where the most retarded community on the entire internet has a chance to be the ones that take down the biggest assholes living on this earth, and literally change the financial world forever. ALL YOU MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SHARES!!!

Fuck the moon, we got the gas the get to Andromeda. Are you willing to come along for the ride and make history? DON'T SELL!"

""Hey S3, If the volume was 50 million on Friday, how did the shorts cover 30 million shares AND the day was red?""

> Timing, Timing, Timing. This is where short sellers put liquidity in the market, as sell orders appeared on the tape short buy to covers took the other side. A really good trader can mix their order flow into the market and create just a ripple and not a tsunami.

Might get buried, but I think people need to see this"
163,"They want you to sell because they loaded up on puts after covering their short sales. A gamma squeeze can work both ways. Just like the squeeze going up when call buying forces market makers to buy stock to hedge, large put buying forces market makers to short stock to hedge. So as the gamma rolls off with options expiration the hedgies are only long puts - not short stock and can wait it out. Now WSB is just playing against itself. And hedge funds are just slowly squeeze it down without a lot of risk.
Otherwise, yes. They are trying to distract with the obviously fake media blitz on silver. Unfortunately, at this point I think it’s the WSBers that are the bagholders and I will be awaiting the loss porn just like I enjoyed the gain porn on the way up.  The brokers screwed you by stopping the squeeze by limiting new options buys and number of shares.  You can’t continue the squeeze just by holding, it has to be continuously more buying to cause a new ramp up.
Yes I’m short. 3/19 20puts. And no, you can’t squeeze me since the premium is already paid so I can’t lose anymore - just like most of the hedge funds. Look at the huge volume and open interest in OTM puts."
164,That data is from Jan 14th. A lot of shit could have happened since then.
165,"AMC was another play. The short on AMC was retardedly high. A week ago they announced that they secured 917 mil in capital to propel them into 2022, so I struck. *That's what I call deep fuckin value*

But, it doesn't have the legs like GME. 

This isn't financial advice, I'm just a frisbee with a mouth hole."
166,"This is how $GME becomes the next $BRK.A, but for the people."
167,"Idiot here as well.

&#x200B;

A short squeeze has nothing to do with share price **once a threshold has been met.** The shares were shorted at much lower prices than we are currently, meaning the interest paid by MMs to borrow them has increased substantially and is accruing as the days go by. They are bleeding money until they buy shares back."
168,"They're not. Everyone is losing their minds over the count at the till, but the shares outstanding are fine.

To the extent the hedgies are doing crazy shit, it's pretty much a sleight of hand to screw with the numbers on failed-to-deliver, stock borrows, and so forth. It's a very X - X + X = X kind of equation.

You'll note they're doing this in the part of the system that doesn't constantly report numbers. That's not an accident. It's a choice. It's the magician palming the quarter.

The final tally of shares is legit. X will equal X when all is said and done.

If it's not, there are much, much bigger problems. That's a Lehman moment.

Also, they're not going to delist GME. That would be unfair to legit shareholders and the company itself.

LK happened because don't invest in Chinese companies ever. It's like buying Greek shippers. It's just a big, dumb no.

A US retailer that's being fucked by hedgies is not the same as a Chinese company that was committing the crimes itself."
169,"If you didn't just do it to A> make money, B> for the lulz, then you have to settle for C> important life lesson.  It was fun, I need a cigarette, let's do this again."
170,Tesla is almost worth $1T. A fucking car company. Billionaires can fuck off with what they “think” stocks are worth
171,"You did lose. You literally lost like, money. A lot of money. A lot of people lost a lot of money. Last I checked, the point of investing was to make money, not piss it away like a drunk miner at a riverboat casino. 

And you will keep losing money, because you are a pack of easily led memers quoting done to death jokes at each other as you goad one another to market armed with a basically inadequate understanding of the stock market and a borderline negligent disregard for risk. 

So let me pose your question back at you. Why are you all acting like you're losing? Because you literally fell victim to your own pump and dump scheme. This is literally the only way I can think of that a basically fraudulent act can be both completely unwitting but also wildly unprofitable. 

The answer is you're acting like you're losing because you are, and it's because some of you are profoundly stupid, some of you just got caught up, and some of you are nihilistic and/or predatory.

EDIT: I should clarify something. I'm not saying this to gloat. I don't have a horse in this race. I stay away from the stock market. I don't like risk. But I see in the comments that some guy put his life savings in at $327. I have no idea how much money that is, maybe his savings were 10k, maybe 100k. He bought in at $327 and now it's at $90. This guy lost three fucking quarters of his life savings and there's no guarantee that he's going to get it back. That breaks my fucking heart. I live like a monk so that I could squirrel away 30k in case whatever. Buy a house, buy a car, have a kid, not eat goya beans every night for the rest of my life. Whatever. If a bunch of people on the internet goaded me into putting all of that into stocks for an irrelevant, brick and mortar retailer *as a fucking joke,* I would blow my head off. Fundamentally he (and others) have nobody to blame but themselves for getting on the carousel but you're all perpetrating a really sick and unfunny joke."
172,"Now that they are practiced at it, can the hedge funds just ladder attack us into oblivion? 

If that's the case we WILL lose because it is working.  


Or is there a limit to its effectiveness? A counter? Or a lower limit that it no longer works at?  


In that case no bell yet."
173,"There's no reason to think there would be a share recall if litigation should proceed. The two matters seem to be unrelated. A trial on the merits of issues relating to allegations of wrongdoing by hedge funds and brokerage firms related to GME and AMC, e.g., is a separate and distinct matter from an entity somehow issuing a share recall. It does not appear that a court would ever order such a thing. All that is relevant is the class of plaintiffs -- who possessed stock at the relevant time and suffered injury as a result of defendants' actions."
174,"No they won't lol.

A select few will.  Most people will continue to throw it in their amazon cart on their couch from their phone.

The rest will grab it at Walmart while they're getting cat food.

Edit:. Goddamn you guys are as deluded as consumers are fickle and unloyal."
175,"The thing being, even at 400 a share, the stock was only worth like 15 Billion. A turn around into a good company could EEEEEEEEASSSSSSSSSSSILY make this into a long term play worth more than that."
176,"> A turn around into a good company

But that's still a tough row to hoe."
177,"I worked 683 hours of overtime for my current company last year only to be passed up for a promotion 3 different times. Fuck them. A few weeks ago I took a sick day to stay at home and work on my resume and apply to jobs. It worked out great, I just accepted an offer for a much more exciting job with a 50% increase to my current salary. I'll be putting in my two weeks notice on Friday and it has felt great walking in to work everyday this week knowing that they won't be my problem for much longer."
178,"I got a performance review of ""High Performance"" which means I recieve the maximum merit increase ..of 5.002%. 

First off: ""Wow, they gave you over 5% this year!"" Was said multiple times.

I recently was placed into a new job role created for me. I spent weeks creating a business case to justify a new pay band and improvement in my compensation.  Im doing the same job, I just do so much it didnt fit the old job description from 4 years ago.

A 5% increase means I earn 91% of the market rate as calculated by my employer...for a job which I was just rated as high performing at.

Employers aren't people. They will never care, be loyal or fight for you. Don't do it for  them."
179,"The reasons not to quit your job are far more practical than that. 

This is a personal finance sub, and I think one thing people don't take into account here is that based on your socio-economic class, personal finance is either a hobby or a necessity depending on where you come from. A lot of people here enjoy playing around with stocks and have ample trust funds and an established cushion - good for them. However, for many other people their retirement savings, mutual or index fund, etc. are where (if they have one at all) they store their rainy day funds in the event of being fired. 

Quitting a job is fine, but only if you've established in advance that you have something else to jump to first and that you can safely do so on (relatively) short notice. 

As for the whole ""family"" thing, I think it's pretty easy to see through that rhetoric: maybe a foster family. However, irl the onboarding process and social dynamics are much more like having been gang-pressed into a pirate crew. Your survival and ""right"" to not have to walk the plank aren't guaranteed, so keep up with the struggle until you can escape."
180,"I have been in a position where leaving when I did completely screwed over some coworkers. I still left, but I offered to buy my team beers after work on my last day just to at least make myself feel a little less guilty.

A few of them took me up on it, and were super happy for me, and basically admitted that they were also looking based on the changes that led me to leaving. 

It's ok to feel bad for the other people you work with, but definitely don't stick around for them, be the motivation that gets them to leave too."
181,Oh man I make to tell anyone who will listen. There is no such thing as loyalty. A company will drop your ass in a minute if it benefits them. Do not ever get complacent. Always look for more money or better benefits
182,"Depends on the company. A blanket statement like this is just as false as saying ""all companies will treat you like family.

Just like employees, there are companies that will use and abuse you. Also, there are employees and companies that will treat you like family."
183,A real family wouldn't hold it against you if you want to move to a better opportunity
184,"The family analogy is so dumb. You're a team, not a family. A family cares for its weakest link, a team cuts it."
185,"Im a boss of 5 employees. I almost always do what’s best for them even at cost to me and we really are a sort of family. 

Having said that if they stopped doing a good job I would let them go and they know it. 

A bad day. A bad week sure. But the reality is I work my ass off and currently make less than they do even. 

We are a different type of family that you can get kicked the fuck out of if you don’t live up to your end of the bargain.

Edit: continuation. 

And I think it’s fair. I learned from my dad who’s companies average employee has been there for 20 years. 

I ask each employee what their goals are and if they are happy often. I have a food business and my employees will all be managers and co owners of future places if they want. I genuinely see them as people I care about and I want what’s best for them whether it’s with or without my company. 

Having said all that the point of this post is make you realize you don’t owe your employers more than the job you’re doing. You should always leave for better. My job as a boss is to make sure if I want to keep you around I make it worth it. 

I treat people well and in return they work hard for me and I have never had a single person quit on me. 

Just as important we are all happy to be there."
186,"A small business can quickly grow into a large one where things have to change. I mean if they have to choose to not take pay and lose their house or cut someone's position, they will be cutting that person. I am not saying don't stay at a ob if you love it. Just to do what is best for you."
187,"Shits complicated.  A team being in a bad spot when someone leaves does not automatically mean that team was understaffed.  Even if they ARE understaffed, it doesn't mean they haven't been trying to fill a spot."

190,"#Watch aftermarket, $GME goes to $400. More evidence hedge funds are manipulating the market.

They buy and sell to each other on low volume while most people can’t buy, to drive down the price. Then, when very few people can trade during after hours they’re going to buy back all those shares to cover their asses.

Fuck these people! A close at $320 would have a lot of options ITM and could cause a gamma squeeze—I wonder if that will happen? Someone not wearing a tin foil hat and with a wrinkled brain uhh make what im saying sound smart and intelligible.

So ""the over 100%"" that you stated are over 100% of the public stocks !!! NOT overall stocks !  
The company(Gamestop) will hold their 51% forever(to keep the majority).  
So NOW the public has to WANT to sell ""A F**KING WHOLE OF A LOT"" or else they(the hedge fund) can't close their positions(they have to buy)(witch they 100% have to).  
And if they 100% have to (wich they do) they have to buy at EvEry price (litteraly every).

It's a rational choice to yolo your 50 and gamble on a chance to get some breathing room or into the middle class, etc.  A few thousand to trade up to a more reliable car can mean the difference in getting a new job further out, cheaper housing, etc.  Positive cascade effect."

GME SQUEEZE

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

212,"Institutional ownership last i checked was at 110%. They can also sell in dark pools, i.e. bypass the open market all together and sell to themselves (or shorts).

So basically if you guys push it up far enough, institutional investors technically would be looking at insane gains, and would be stupid not to cut a deal with the shorts to allow them cover behind the scenes.

One day, the short squeeze is no longer a possibility and the retail traders are left deciding if they want to keep bidding for $10k shares of GME, which is now, at $10k  a trillion dollar company. or salvage what little they have left.

You are also making one fatal assumption that 100% of retail is in it for the movement and not for the quick buck. A guy made a comment here yesterday that ""i don't know what happened but somehow i sold at 450"". When challenged, admitted that he had a limit sell order for $450. A lot of people in my trading group have also day traded GME.

I believe in the movement and wish you the best of luck (i'm even holding a couple shares myself), but don't underestimate the self serving nature of humans.

In summary, we are playing a game of musical shares (get it) but there are people behind the scenes already seated who have extra seats that they could basically choose who gets to sit on."

Unfortunately, Fidelity only lets you set Limit Orders to 50% above the current market price. If you tried to set a limit order you couldn’t set it any higher than about $500 at the moment. IMO, with Fidelity, don’t set any sell orders (set a limit quickly if the shares reach $5000-10000)"

Look i'm not saying don't buy GME. By all means please do. I'm on your side. Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

But i'm TELLING you! The mining deficit is real! The suppression of the gold and silver price is REAL! There has been delivery wall after delivery wall since April 2020 on the Comex. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THAT! We even have signs that the LBMA is running out:

223,"Most people here are too young to remember this happening, or the significance of who did it and why.   
That's a deep wormhole way beyond this summary of sorts.  


""Silver Thursday was an event that occurred in the United States silver commodity markets on Thursday, March 27, 1980, following the attempt by brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt and Lamar Hunt to corner the silver market. A subsequent steep fall in silver prices led to panic on commodity and futures exchanges.""

Unless investing is your actual job (and you're competent at it), don't invest anything you can't afford to lose.

227,"I'm one of the newcomers here and I genuinely like this sub. The loss porn, people buying stuff for shits and grins(with a DD) and getting a kick out of it whether it goes down or up. The people here seem cool and thats all I'll preface this with.

I felt similarly. I heard about the hype and figured whatever I'll give it a shot and see what happens. I bought 40 shares of AMC because I figured it made more sense than 2 shares of GME. I decided to keep it to about 500 because I wasn't willing to lose more if it went tits up. I didnt really think about the message of this post until later so thankfully I'm a little bit of a coward, financially speaking. 

I just to say that I read some of the people posts about loans of using retirement or whatever they were and while I don't know their financial situation and can only know mine some of the numbers actually worried me what I was seeing. I genuinely hope the stocks go back up. Not for me but those people. 

Guys and gals, it's been a real lesson and learning experience. I hope the $ROPE joke is just that. A joke. The main reason Im writing this is to say this.

I'm 190% sure the people downvoting these comments were the same retards YOLO'ing their grandmas funds into GME at it's peak.

I don't think anyone who has been here longer than 2 weeks actually felt that an exit plan was a bad idea. Loss porn is good and juicy but when it floods the sub it gets kinda stale tbh.

I'd rather people post gains too in contrast to the losses, which is why I'll always support people who present real exit-strategies to hype-trains like GME because many people legitimately did make A LOT of money

it was so heart-warming to see people making  hundreds of G's and donating them to children's hospitals and paying their grandmas surgeries and student-loans off.

THAT is what I live for and what I LOVE to see here. People actually realizing their gains to do some good, not holding all of it (even though you definitely should hold SOME of it) like actual idiots thinking the price will hit 700 dollars."

However, this lends itself to a problem where people blame all the losses on the QB as well, even when the QB isn't being supported with decent weapons like:

* a decent solid wide receiver (being allowed to teach the best theories we have, not the ones angry people prefer)
* a solid running game to keep the defense honest (being able to teach logic and reason without Reputards trying to dismantle reality)
* decent coaching (leadership that has their back and provides policies that help instead of )
* decent management (politicians that speak out against union busting, believe in paying teachers a fair wage, or just the fact that Betsy Fucking Devos happened)
* decent ownership (providing funds to education so that they don't have to take money, remove school programs, or run goddam GoFundYourself pages just to pay for fucking classroom supplies)
* A fan base that isn't fucking stupid (parents that get shitty when they have to learn a better way of trying to understand math because it isn't they way they learned, or just gets mad about evolution in general)
* Protection against scalpers so regular fans can enjoy the fucking game, too instead of dopy shits that have more money than brains and... I don't know. The analogy is kind of falling apart here. (Education costs are way too fucking high and financiers are the only winners of this shit, amirite?)

Teachers have their hands on the minds of the youth, so people are prone to blaming them for shaping those minds even as they disagree on how they should be shaped and lack better ideas.

255,"Someone please tell me if this is correct... 

Okay, first off, I am not a financial advisor and this is not advice. Fuck off if you're basing your decisions on this. I'm retarded, you are too, listen to actual experts.

So this morning I was looking over some data and realized a lot of people may be missing something important here - everyone on Wall Street has advanced trading data. They can see how many shares are floating, what stop losses and limit sells are set to, and can manipulate prices to hit those targets as needed.

What this means is if you bought in @ 150 and set your stop loss to 200, and enough people set the same stop loss.. Melvin can get the price down to 200 and it'll trigger a mass sell-off in which they can scoop up those shares to cover their shorts.

By examining limit sell and stop loss triggers, they can strategically maneuver prices as needed to cover their asses. This could be involved in the crash Thursday and potentially mean a lot of the shorts got covered.

In order for the squeeze to truly be squoze, any potential holders of GME would hypothetically need to know this data as well and position themselves accordingly. If there were no stop losses in place, and say 80% of limit sells set at $2k/share - that's what the price would, theoretically, arrive at.

However, doing this would also prevent you from having any protection whatsoever. IF the price fell, you'd not trigger a stop loss, and you'd be out your shirt. I do NOT advise anyone to do this. I do not advise anyone in any context at all whatsoever. Just sharing my theory on how the market mechanics are currently working.

Maybe some autists with better data and expertise can chime in here. But to my understanding, with the advanced data institutional investors have available, they can effectively manipulate the market however needed to outmaneuver retail investors. Who are also, by the way, 16% of the total GME shareholders (correct me if mistaken please).

I have a small 40 share holding in GME. I personally am receptive to riding it to dust. I'd love to make profit, but if that was my primary motive, I wouldn't still be holding those shares.

AGAIN FOR THE KIDS IN THE BACK, I AM A RETARD. A TRUE AUTIST WOULD NEED TO VALIDATE MY RUDIMENTARY UNDERSTANDING.

For what it's worth though, the GME heroes would theoretically need to outmaneuver the outmaneuvering in order for the squeeze to truly succeed. Power to the people or something idfk."
256,"EVEN IF YOU'RE SUCH A COWARD AND YOU SELL, make sure you buy when the stock goes low if not you really are an asshole."
257,"For anyone watching the situation on GME, please also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1.	⁠Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.
2.	⁠After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.
3.	⁠Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.
4.	⁠Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.
5.	⁠We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.
6.	⁠If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.
7.	⁠If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.
8.	⁠If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.
9.	⁠Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.
10.	⁠It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

You're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill."

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**🚀** **🚀🚀🚀** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

Positions: 1400 shares @ 39, multiple calls in April

294,"I’ve long considered things like this if I ever made it big, won the lottery, or came across a windfall of some kind.  The catch is there needs to be management or... I dunno, protections?  Basically, make sure the problem doesn’t happen again.  Not the pipes problem, the people problem.  As I understand it, Flint has the money and [a lot of it is already solved](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/23/flint-water-crisis-2020-post-coronavirus-america-445459).  Flint’s lead problem came to light *seven years* ago.  But corruption issues dragged out the process and the work itself was time consuming.  A direct infusion of cash won’t necessarily solve that.


That said, if I had the means, I’d absolutely give anonymously to organizations at the individual level.  One example:  I friggin love the Pennsylvania Train Museum.  It seems like they put a lot into their work, the museum itself is really cool and they have some great volunteers and mechanics.  But a large portion of their collection is outside and exposed to the elements because, well, the building is only so big.  They need $2MM to build another structure.   So, my move would be essentially to walk into the finance office with a big bag of money.  “Hello, I understand you need to build a protective structure for these priceless historical mechanical marvels.  I represent an anonymous donor.  Here’s $250,000 to get you started.  See you in six months.”  How much fun would that be!

I’m assuming I wouldn’t ever be able to have enough money to BUILD a hospital or start a university or something like that, but schools that need things.  Fire departments.  Hospitals.  Libraries.  Senior care.  At risk kids.  Scholarships.  Work local, stay quiet about it.  That’s my vision.

Now if WSB started actually tackling problems like this, I wouldn’t complain.  We’d have to be careful, but I’m sure even a bunch of internet crazies could wrangle the necessary expertise to make it effective.  Flint isn’t the only place with lead problems, just maybe the most famous.  We could probably do a lot of good."

299,"A year ago my Cox plan was 'unlimited'. Then it turned to a 1TB limit with data caps and overage charges with zero improvements and speed degrades due to extra tracking.  

Then after a year or 18 months I got tired of overages, they suddenly add back 'unlimited' but it is 150% the old 'unlimited' rate.  

The new trick is removing unlimited, then implementing or tightening data caps, then adding unlimited back again at a minimum of 50% increase of cost.  Then do this annually or every 1-2 years.  

AT&T did the same thing with the grandfathered 'unlimited' plans on mobile, they kept upping the cost, then you had to switch to metered, then 'unlimited' comes back at a minimum of 50% increase.  This is the new game. 40-50% increase by switching between metered/limited and 'unlimited' which they nerf you after 20GB.

I guess since healthcare and tuition go up by 20-50% every year that broadband and telcos were sad they weren't in on the new middle class killing predatory pricing that happens in the US now."
300,"Spectrum pulled this on me as well.  ""Free upgrade"" in speed from 40 to 60mbps. A month later I got a bill for $5/ month extra which my ""promotion"" ended. 

I told them I didn't remember I was on a promotion and asked for it to be taken off. Which they said the previous speed was only for new customers and i was basically locked into the new price.... FUCK THAT. 

I told them I wanted my internet cancelled a week from that date and got off the phone. Called immediately back and signed up under my wife's name as a ""new customer"" saving $15/month. Setup a spectrum tech appointment the same day as my cancel. Thanks for the saving spectrum. "
301,"Alright, so I worked for AT&T in the ""Unified Collections"" department. You know how if you have more than one service with AT&T, they may talk to you about combining your bills for a discount? Once they are combined, they are handled in a new department. Now, we get the short of the stick there as while each department is responsible for itself, we were responsibily knowing the full extent of all of these departments: U-verse, Mobility (cell phones), DirectV, and finally the other portion of u-verse (their television). I myself worked there for a little while and ended up heading an MST team (they are the ""managers"" you talk to. Yes, you don't actually talk to our managers, they are just a team of people with a little more power and freedom and able to descalate. Funny story about the MST, when you ask to speak to an MST's manager, we would just pass it to another person on the MST. haha). I also did training, so I know those four departments like the back of my hand. I no longer work there, but it wasn't that long ago I did.

Things to consider about OP's situation: It's very likely he had a discount before they upgraded his internet, and that discount would have been running off at the same time as this one is, and thus the net price would be the same. I can't know for sure as it's not like I can access his account. If you view your bill before and after the change happened, you might see something surprising. It could also have been his contract which ensured he got a price is running up finally, and he should call back and get another one, but it all depends on his situation. 

Honestly, with all the issues going on, you'd be surprised how little of it is a true AT&T error and how much of it is just deceptive advertising. Your first bill from them (if combined billing) may be 2x the price you are expecting, but that is because you already technically had a bill that had a balance of 0.00, it's just not explained well. It's absolutely AT&T's fault for not training their employee's near well enough, and not explaining anything to the customers. However, I think in this case what happened is his contract is up, U-Verse typically has a price guarantee contract you sign for either two or three years, so this would make sense (it can be 2 1/2 years as well).

/u/ghostofgbt I would go ahead and recommend you call the IVR (The number on your bill) and talk to a rep and ask to speak to sales to get another contract signed up for your internet to save money. That, or you can talk to loyalty and say you are displeased about them not notifying you and you're going to leave them unless they get your price down. 

For anyone else with AT&T problems, I will go ahead and say that in my entire time working there, if it was ever found to be an AT&T error, it would always be corrected (albeit you'd have to call about it, the system doesn't just catch it), and you'd be given credits as well. A large part of why your bill goes up and everything has to do with all the fine terms, like I know in unified you got a certain amount off your bill for 3 services combined, versus 2, and u-verse was required for any discount. There's a lot of fine details, but if you have patience and talk to their reps, or look at the bill yourself online, you should be able to find it.

However! There are a lot of shitty reps in AT&T, not all departments are created equally, much less the CSR's themselves. So, it may require jumping around.

Final notice here is this is for base AT&T stuff and not the acquired DirecTV. I will go ahead and say right now that DirecTV scams its users, to the point that it should be illegal. They will give you an early termination fee you don't know about, when the sales rep may assure you there is none. They WILL say they they have fixed it and removed it, while not actually removing it at all. I would say avoid getting DirecTV at all costs, and if you must, then record what the sales rep tells you and make him write down his DirecTV number on a paper that also says you will not have to pay an ETF. Seriously, in the time I was working there I saw in the notes alone plenty of examples of where stuff was supposed to be removed (like, the notes said they were going to remove it), and then it was never done. Do not trust DirecTV and monitor your bill closely. 

Alright that's all I have to say, figured my insight could help a few know what to do. Feel free to ask if anyone has any quick questions about AT&T billing or resources to fix them and monitor. I obviously can't go into AT&T policy without getting arrested, but I can definitely guide the way to making sure you get the best you can out of your AT&T service. Finally, only billing, loyalty, or managers can issue credits that are not caused by an actual error (but something that was confusing or bad service), so don't demand credits from your customer service reps. You are going to get them if there was an actual AT&T ""error"" (sorry, I can't define them, but pretty much system messed up or something), however you are still entitled to credits if you were told one thing and another happens, so feel free to get to a manager for that.

Also I will never have AT&T, after working there. I work for t-mobile now, dealing with small/medium businesses, but I know those who are just basic CSRs and I can say if you want a company that actually has decent customer service and more lenient policies, go to them. 

"
302,"So glad I dropped this garbage company last year. The tipping point for me came when I went in to change something about my phone plan and they had a salesperson try to pitch U-Verse to me. I was 100% not interested and said as much, but the salesperson kept pushing so finally I agreed to have a rep come out to my house and talk to me more about U-Verse. I have a hard time just saying no and by this point I just wanted to conversation to end so I could leave, which is the only reason I agreed to this. I made very sure to have the salesperson verify that this was JUST for someone to come to my house to TALK about the service, I wasn't agreeing to purchase anything. She said that was the case, and so I left. A month later I had forgotten about it until I get a call from AT&T to confirm that I would be home for somebody to come out and install U-Verse. I said absolutely not and told them I didn't want it and I didn't want anyone to come to my house. I was freaking livid. I hate AT&T, and with that incident, among many other shady practices, I am no longer a customer. I honestly can't understand how they are able to get away with shit like that and stay in business."
303,"A comcast salesperson called recently advertising a promotion that would double my speed and give HBO ""For only $2 more!"" He was so confused when I declined the offer. It sounded like he couldn't even fathom why I would say no.

For anyone wondering, I declined because I was super busy and didn't want to have to worry about paying attention to when the promotion ended to avoid getting slapped with a huge bill."
304,"> Comcast tried that with someone I know. When he complained about the massive overages and wanted an uncapped connection, they said he needed a business account

THIS! I WAS TOLD THIS! Except they didn't say there was no data cap with the business account. They flat out said,

THERE IS NO PLAN THAT DOES NOT HAVE A DATA CAP. 

Repeatedly. Over the last couple of years.

Also, I work from home. I was told that Comcast would not reimburse me for outages, and lost wages due to THEIR equipment outside my apt building failing. That if I wanted to be reimbursed, to upgrade to business service (which is not available here) Because only business class service gets reimbursed for outages.

""Wait...you are telling me that even though your equipment is faulty, I lost wages, you will not reimburse me for the time lost? I should just keep sending in my seventy five dollars a month, even though my service is out half the time?""

'Yes'

""But...even though you are acknowledging your outside equipment is faulty, you are recommending I pay for the SAME SERVICE AND SPEED, at a higher rate, so I can get reimbursed for the faulty service?!!?!?""

'Yes'

I kid you not, that was the exact fucking conversation. I couldn't wrap my mind around it, and had to keep asking it, rewording it, hooping I could parse it into some kind of reasoning that I could understand. Nope, never could figure that one out.

"
305,"Yep. I paid my last Comcast bill and turned the equipment in IN PERSON TO THEIR ACTUAL OFFICE. I specifically asked if I owed anything further. ""Nope"". Guess what I got a few months later? A random $210 bill they tried to collect on. I told em to fuck themselves and never heard a peep about it again. "
306,I dropped stuff off at Comcast for my parents once. Took pictures of everything I was returning and asked for receipts as well as a note from a manager that stated that everything we were renting was returned. My parents made fun of me. A few months later they got a call saying they where being charged for all the equipment because they failed to return any of it. They were suddenly very happy with all the documentation I did.
307,A $5 wifi fee?  I'm not even sure how that works.
308,"> I'm taking your call after you've been on hold for so long

I worked at an answering service around 2000. We took calls for Adelphia, they had a habit of transferring phone calls to us AFTER the customer had been put on hold for over 20-30 minutes. Now the customer thinks they can finally vent on someone, but no... it's just me. A completely unrelated answering service peon.

The training video told us under no circumstances should we EVER say ""I'm sorry, I'm just the answering service"". Minutes after the video we were told by the trainer to ignore that part in particular, specifically because of Adelphia."
309,">But this is an easy way to get sued. 

A multinational multibillion dollar company? Good luck with that in the US. If they could be held sufficiently accountable for these practices, they would not occur so regularly, if at all.

Maybe I'm unlucky, but I've never not seen a massive company engage in similar practices. I believe these practices are intentional, and probably calculated.

When executives and management are obsessed with increasing profits, and there is little to no accountability for unlawful behavior, they do whatever they can get away with. Improving services or offering new services are much less profitable than these practices."
310,"I'd bet there's a ton of errors in their system, the employees care little.    A computer spits out a list of ""unreturned equipment"" customers, full of errors.  If you don't have proof, Comcast makes extra money.   Win win for Corporate - underpaid/ understaffed/ untrained personnel, nets either cash from you, or a ""lost equipment"" tax write-off.    Shameless thieves. "
311,"Something also to note is that the thermal reacting chemicals are bad for you and you should avoid touching them as much as possible. I've seen people holding a receipt in their mouth or running it through their fingers, and it makes me cringe every time. A lot of people handle them just before eating too, ie when a place is busy and you get given a number on a receipt etc. It messes with your hormones.

And they do it well, they manipulate and devide us even within this group. Playing on our emotions they are making us our own worst enemy. New ppl here trying to chip in easy make the wrong choices, bet on the wrong stock at the wrong time and pulling out again at the wrong time, simply because we're to emotional and to retarded to know what we are doing.

So I was thinking. I use eToro myself, and one feature I like about eToro is that you can copy the trades of another investor. What if I and all others here could just follow the trades of a few ppl here that actually know what they are doing and follow a set strategy in doing it. 

And that lead me to think couldnt we as a community create a joint fund that does the actual investments. A fund like that would really have some 💎💎🖐️🖐️ and could really make a lasting impact preventing hedge funds from even over exposing there short positions ever again. And of course help us little guys to 🚀🚀🚀 on our investments. I could really get behind such a fund. 

Maybe it's a bad idea, or maybe not, I don't know I'm just a retard losing money right now..  Again. But that's not even the point. Point is there is so much misdirection in this group right now, and maybe with something like this we can hold strong together against the WS establishment better, using the system to beat the system.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is  💎🙌 ).

Who    would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated    by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering  the   price down to 170$ the day before?

Every    single day we  💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's    boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've    already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all    the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting    by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but    some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and    what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).    They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will  be   reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive   the  stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).    TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right    now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME  has a   way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on  the   ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused  by   social media clout the past week).

PART  2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys,  *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*.   Fuck off,  please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read   half-assed DDs in  the middle of the stock movement of the century.

These   are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond   full of gold we're  drinking from right now. There will be more, so   please, LISTEN to my  TL;DR.

[And here's another if you want to post it outside of Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/user/_-Al/comments/l8l36k/im_so_fucking_proud_of_you_fools_how_theyre_going/)"
323,"> AMC is a good option for people that missed the boat on GME. Most of you that are actually going to make money on GME got in when the price was in single or double digits. That’s where AMC is right now

Exactly. I have one share of GME but I can't really afford to buy more at this price considering the risk. I missed getting in early. AMC, however, is still at a completely reasonable price (undervalued IMO) and has a lot of room to run, especially considering A. Massive short volume B. Theaters set to re-open and get post-COVID boom later in the year and C. The company being in a much better position financially thanks to this run. It may not be the perfect storm of GME, but it still has massive potential and it's another opportunity to fuck the hedge funds"
324,"Couple things on this though:

1. AMC does have the second most shorted positions on it (behind GME) and a lot of them are from back when it was $2, $3 so there are hedge funds with a vested interest in the stock price coming down because they need to buy A LOT of it. Maybe people with GME shorts want to “deflect” but they are deflecting onto the next biggest shorted stock with people bleeding money every day they don’t close out.

2. AFTER it was known that it was highly shorted, AMC announced they raised almost a billion dollars.  That’s what brought the stock to $4-$5.  Since then they have announced they sold stock and essentially closed their debts so the company isn’t going anywhere.

3. This sub is in a grey area where we are not trying to give “financial advice” or “colluding” so posts like this telling everyone to sell everything else and put all their money in one stock is skirting a fine line.


But here’s your TLDR.  I like the movies. I like the stock.  So I’m going to hold my GME and I’m going to hold my AMC."
325,"A Good example of media manipulation in conjunction with hedge funds was Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD)
Two CNN reporters published a hit piece about Acads only drug, mentioned that already 400 patients have died from the drug and even at Ph3 study, many patients died. This caused another FDA review of the drug and the company crashed by around 70% over the next months, as many news outlets copied the story without checking. 1.5 years later in misery, the FDA concluded that everything was alright and nothing had to be changed - shares popped through the roof, shorts long gone, no investigation against the authors of the hit piece, no excuse - this is the way 🤷‍♂️

Now my autistic way: The Ph3 study results were public - Everyone could read that the avg. age of the participants was in the mid 70s. People die at that age - especially when they have Parkinson. 
=> It was an unwrapped present after reading the Ph3 report and just getting on the other side of the trade against the shorts 🎉🎉🎉"

Posting for visibility:

THIS IS THE HEDGE FUNDS PLAYBOOK ON HOW TO ATTACK US AND REDUCE THE PRICE

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.


Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.


One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube."

He goes over a number of topics just as FTD's (Failures to deliver), how prevalent they are, how long they can last for and the risk they pose to the financial system. He also talks about the DTCC and it's role in clearing money and shares through the market and how it has a history of downplaying the amount of FTD's.

Case study: In the final days of selling of Lehman Brothers stock there we over 150M failures to delivery naked shares sold short when the stock was selling for about $0.10. Imagine LEH ended up not going bankrupt. Imagine something happened and the price suddenly rebounded dramatically. These 150M naked shorts would be caught with their pants down and it would get bloody. The amount it would cost the financial system is the actual number of shares out there x the mean price those shareholders are willing to sell them for (knowing they have the buyers bent over a barrel). There have only ever been 71M shares of GME issued but institutions claim they own 102M shares of GME so how many shares are out there? Lets guess there are actually 200M shares out there and the average shareholder sells for $1000. That's $200B. If there is 333M shares and a $3000 share price that's $1T off of a measly $1B company that naked short sellers got greedy on. Who's going to foot this bill?

TLDR; We're probably not even buying and selling actual shares of GME. When it looked like GME was ""on the ropes"" and there was a good narrative of why they should go bankrupt naked short sellers likely naked short sold an unknowable amount of fake ""IOU"" shares of GME because they thought it would for sure go bankrupt. This plan has worked for them hundreds and hundreds of times in the past making them hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Some high profile examples include: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these sharks smell blood in the water nothing is stopping them from naked short selling tens of millions of fake shares (over 100M in the last three days of Lehman Brothers) to innocent buyers who think they're getting a good deal which ultimately go to zero and equate to an infinite profit margin for the short sellers. What they didn't expect with GME was a bunch of retards doing what we've done over the past months and exposing their fraudulent naked short selling. We have no way to be certain how many shares are actually out there but [/u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/u/johnnydaggers/) post shows there was 1.7M shares failed to deliver in December (before shit even hit the fan). The thing is this threatens to undermine the publics confidence in the entire system. How do we know that the shares that we think we are purchasing are actually legit? We could literally being paying good money for something that doesn't actually exist. What this means for GME is someone is going to have to step up and actually pay up for all of these phantom shares that aren't even supposed to exist. What price they will pay nobody knows."
337,"Nice try with the FUD. PhD and this the best you got? FOH. The share numbers don't add up because as [bohoo123er](https://www.reddit.com/user/bohoo123er/) mentioned, you don't account for investors lending shares out. Also, the data you linked to shows each stock's fail to deliver on each day of December. According to the [link](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) you provided, ""Fails to deliver on a given day are a **cumulative** **number** **of all fails outstanding until that day**, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, **these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails.**"" 

Why are you summing each GME line if each value is already an aggregation up until that date? You're giving us a sum of cumulative sums. Even these numbers don't add up:

338,"CONTACT YOUR BROKER AND REQUEST A CERTIFICATE OF YOUR SHARE HOLDINGS.

It might take days or weeks but it will send every broker scrambling to account for the shares they've 'sold'. If this analysis is real (let's face it, SEC filings alone account for supposedly 145% of the total shares being 'owned') and that was in December. These funds don't churn shares on a daytrade basis, they buy and hold over months to years as part of large index funds.

Your broker wil start assigning and accounting for their shares and this WILL reduce the available supply.

145% + retail holdings = how many fucking percent shares owned out there?!

At last count I saw WSB had accounted for 5.8% or so of total shares. And that's ignoring all those who didn't contribute to the survey. I wouldn't bat an eyelid if WSB alone had 10%."

# OP IS RIGHT

I keep thinking about how weird exchanges' behavior was on Thurs-Friday. Why would they ban buys but not sales?  Why did RH have 1 share limits on Friday, even after new liquidity was made available to execute trades? Robinhood has even [shut off the ability for people to transfer stocks to other exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xv7p/robinhood_now_blocks_users_from_getting_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). On top of that, hundreds of people were claiming RH closed and sold their call options contracts, without their permission, at the lowest market price, even if they paid with cash. I think we got it. Retail traders own over 100% of the float.

There is one firm who clears 95% of **all** traded stock (DTC). They normally require clearing houses to pay 1-2% of that stock's price as collateral while they carry out the trade. On Thursday, the [CEO of Webull disclosed collateral requirements were suddenly raised to 100%](https://youtu.be/4RS4JIEVyXM?t=160). It sounds like something they'd do if they needed to buy back stock at a 2:1 ratio, right?. There have also been what looks like several ""short ladder attacks"" on these stocks the last few days tanking the price 20-30% before it rockets back up. Could another possibility be that exchanges are scrambling to balance their books and logging 2 sales for every 1 buy? They're shitting bricks and cooking the books, hoping no one catches them before they're done!

That might explain some exchanges 1 share limit too. It artificially boosts buy demand towards new buyers. If I own 7 shares, and someone else owns 5, but half of those shares don't exist, it'd be counterproductive for orders to exchange through us. However, If we both put one up for sale, the exchange could take 1 fake share from me, and one real share from the other, and give the real share to the new buyer.

# Edit:

Elon Musk interviewed Vlad (Robinhood CEO) last night on the [clubhouse tonight podcast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkd2sYqvVzY) The exchanges appear to be the scapegoats not the perpetrators. DTC raised RH's daily collateral requirement from about $50-200 million to $3 Billion. Keep in mind, RH has only raised $2 Billion in capital since its inception. This goes all the way up to the covering houses and DTC. Vlad can't directly call them out, because they set his collateral prices every single day, and they control 95% of the trade so there's no competitors to go to. A financial cartel headed by Citadel and DTC have him by the fucking balls. All he has to do is sneeze in the wrong direction and they double the daily collateral requirements forever.."

If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but Robinhood who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when Robinhood's order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME can still be squoze for all the aforementioned reasons above. Thank you for taking your time to read my DD, please mods do not delete."
349,"Yes this is exactly what has likely happened.  Shorts took on synthetic long positions as the stock fell to make it look like they covered and hedge deltas.

There are also clearly too many shares outstanding, but I'm not sure that technically needs to be resolved yet.  A reverse split or special dividend would require reconciliation I'd imagine - but normally share count mismatches don't really matter as long as you get your money when you place a sell order in your brokerage."
350,A fucking men. Actual data. Evidence. Conclusion: the game hasn’t stopped.
351,"I'm thinking it will be 1) a hedge fund or group of them fucking over current shorts or 2) Gamestop releases news to F them over

Companies shorted to this degree are not happy about it. Naked shorting essentially dilutes their current owners and increases their cost to raise capital. The fact that Gamestop hasn't even discussed an offering or communicated, makes me think they are analyzing this carefully (or maybe they are as retarded as I am and they are just doing nothing lol).

If they did some kind of recall (I don't even know how this works to be honest) I wonder if they could then negotiate an offering with all the naked shorts?

Another possible trigger would be pre-announcing earnings and naming Ryan Cohen CEO, but I'm not sure if that was ever in the original plan for RC. He's obviously intelligent and has the ear of the board, but if he becomes the voice of Gamestop, I wonder if that's enough to trigger a mad dash for the exits.

Everytime I'm nervous about this stock, I just think about the HFs that are short and they have to be just as nervous. This is a ticking timebomb with this short interest and having no idea what your victim (Gamestop) is thinking about.

A game of chess at its finest."
352,"Here's a good quote from a wise man.  

""IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE IN A COMPLETELY FRAUDULENT SYSTEM."""
353,"A little of column A a little of column B. I plan on holding GME forever. I personally believe that it is still hyper shorted. I’ve set price alerts and now I’m just going to walk away for a while. All the media manipulation just acts as confirmation to me since it’s clear that somebody with power wants me/us to sell- and I take great joy in knowing that my shares may be causing some billionaire out there to lose sleep.

If it squeezes I’ll sell my RH holdings, then buy the dip on my main brokerage account. I smell Hedge fund blood in the water, and they’re still bleeding, their only salvation is if I sell my shares before they buy the ones they are contractually obligated to buy.

Regardless of squeeze or not, I also see a lot of potential in GameStop to pivot to e-commerce. In addition I could see them capitalizing on their retail locations to create community centers in a post-Covid landscape for esports gamers. They also have a couple of other assets I would be using more efficiently if I were in their position- which I think they will be. (Their magazine and their powerup rewards members, both of which could be re-tooled to engage the cult like following/attention their stock has garnered)

The main concern against them had been about the viability of physical copies of games... which is a moot point IMO for the next 4-5 years or so given that the next gen of consoles will still have a physical disc drive. As someone with knowledge of the music industry, I don’t think that digital will completely overtake physical- there is usually a cult following of legacy media (vinyls for music, discs/cartridges for gaming, physical books (vs. Ebooks) for readers, etc.) that will still exist for a generation or so- particularly for hipsters and people distrustful of digital ownership."

Not only is he pushing unity and at least adopting more left leaning, take-on-wall-street talking points, but also has to take into consideration how fucking volatile America is at the moment. A Biden administration intervening against the retail investor would be the nail in the coffin for Dems in 2022, which will already be challenging enough.

363,"Alright retards. We have held the line so far. If our diamond hands hold, the squeeze will be coming. 

When we finally see GME 🚀🚀🚀 there will be paper hands who will sell at some price points on the way. Most of them will be unretarded GME holders who are holding most of GME floats right now and don't share our love for the stock. Some of them will be fellow retards who have to give their dog surgery or put their girlfriends boyfriend through college, some of them may be you. Whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember.

**WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT STOCK GOES UP IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT STOCK DOESNT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN**

This 🚀🚀🚀🚀 will keep flying as long as it doesn't hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts. This means that even when GME drops at some point, as long as it doesn't drop low enough for hedges to cover, the fuel will keep coming. There is an easy way to keep this up.

**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**

As far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.

**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**

I have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key. In normal stocks when price falls, people panic and sell until there is nothing left. You retards don't know how to sell and there is way too many of you.

Also I don't fucking know what I'm talking about. I bought my first stock yesterday. This is not financial advice. I'm just a retard. If you listen to me, you're an even bigger retard

tl;dr: BUY GME, HOLD GME

if 🧻🙌🧻🙌🧻 -> BUY GME AGAIN, HOLD GME"
364,"Sorry, intregued normie here.

Can somebody help me understand something?

A hedge fund has a massive fortune to invest as it pleases. One organisation can choose to invest wherever. (Even sometimes naked shorts).

On the other hand we have a group of individuals who individually chose to buy stonk. Their summed available funds are most likely lower than these hedge funds.

So why is this ""market manipulation"" based on #investors instead of invested funds by a singular entity?

Even if all the auties here would decide to buy one type of stonk,  it has still less impact than one massive hedge fund?

Or is the game rigged so badly?"
365,"Yeah no shit....

Lot of actual idiots in here now. Not r/wsb ""Hey I just made a dumb investment, look how retarded I am"" idiots. I mean actual idiots that have no fucking idea what they're doing and just smelled free money.

Disclaimer: To be fair, I'm a fresh retard myself and free money smell is the only reason I'm here so maybe I'm being a little hypocritical, but at least I can say I've spent the last week trying to educate myself on how the stock market works instead of shitposting about ""ladder attacks"" and other dumb shit I don't know anything about."

376,"> Which, I would personally consider statistically relevant.

Fortunately we have actual math to tell is whether or not this is truly statistically relevant.

So given 11 insider trading senators, how significant is it that 9 of these 11 are republican?

If we assume the senate is about 50/50 D/R (close enough, even if it leaned 60/40 in either direction the numbers would basically be the same). We'll say there are 50 Ds and 50 Rs.

Pulling 11 Ss from this pool completely randomly yields a 3.27% chance of 9 of them being R.

A sample size of 11 (out of 100) gives us a confidence level of 70% and a margin of error of 15% [source](https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=1&cl=70&ci=15&pp=50&ps=100&x=45&y=2).

I do not even need to check the p-table to tell you that this will yield a p-score far above 0.05, thus letting us say this is clearly not statistically significant."

Anyways, 30 days passed after I moved out and he texted me saying was going to send me an invoice and my deposit with the funds removed within a week. I texted him back saying the 30 days had expired and I was going to sue him for double damages in small claims court if he didn't send me the full amount. The next message I got was ""sent"" I got the check for the full amount a week later. I guess he didn't want to fly to Ohio from California to appear in court. Damn I felt good when I got that check."
381,"A drunk driver with a suspended license and no car insurance rear ended me the very first day I got my car. Didn’t even have plates on it yet. I got an estimate for restitution and provided to the DA.  Called up like 9 months later to ask when I can expect to receive any payments from this and was told they forgot about it. 

Who do I complain to if the DA (district attorney) “forgot” about my restitution costs before he let the drunk driver who hit me off probation? I got him the estimate on time and the lady on the phone just said they forgot about it, and now that he is off probation there is nothing I can do but file a small claim, which I am not bothering with nor should I have to.

I think they basically didn’t feel like dealing with my resistition costs bedsuse he wasn’t even paying court fees. So they locked him up for 8 months instead of collecting their money. I think they didnt feel like dealing with him being on probation just to collect my restitution, so they just said “screw it”.

382,"My parents were kinda screwed over in a contract for their security system. When they had it installed 2 years ago they were told that the contract they were signing was for 2 years. A couple montha ago they called the company in regards to discontinue their services and they found out that they were lied to and that they're stuck in either a 5 or 10 year contract, can't remember which. Any info you could give me where a complaint could be filed for this?"
383,"A word from the middle upper class. Read this post!! Learn about your finances and what effects them. Take your credit score/rating seriously. You CAN change it. You CAN learn about the system, it's complex, but not complicated. Take this shit personally, and things will become much better, and much clearer. Do NOT chalk it up to blackmagic fuckery. They do NOT teach this in school, but they should.


The poorer people are, the more they can learn from this. And if you're thinking you only made it through X grade of whatever. Forget that, this isn't hard to learn, but they make you think it is. If there's anything in life you put extra effort into, this is a good thing to choose for that. Because while family, and love, and children are definitely more important, being financially secure, make all those things better. :) 

P.S. No idea if anyone reads this, but i hope someone does. It's the information every teenager should be given when they come of age. And it's a shame they don't. "
384,"I remember when I was a kid and we were moving, we canceled our Comcast account and they came to take away the cable box. A week later we got bill for 600$ for the box it wasn't damaged or nothing they just said it wasn't returned . My dad was livid he went to the Comcast building. He told us wait in the car and asked what the hell was going on we stayed for an hour until they told us they found it in the Comcast van lol fuck them trying to charge us 600$ for their mistake. "
385,"For years we have suspected that someone has been getting into our storage unit and going through our things. After obvious internal ""shuffling"" around of boxes and then empty boxes and a slowly expanding empty space all without ANY initial signs of forced entry I started exploring an and all ways of possible entry into or out of our units. At each new minor Discovery of possible tampering and some major obvious ones, I would discuss with the owner or manager and even police who I have called out several times to view my ""evidence"", that's what they all refer to it as IF I can get ANYONE to write anything down, ""evidence"", and they make me feel like a TOTAL IDIOT. Everyone who works there and even the non emergency line of the local police....
And yet time goes on and my pile of what's left in my two adjoining 10x30 foot ALMOST 500 PER MONTH WITH REQUIRED WORTHLESS STORAGE COMPANY OWNED INSURANCE PREMIUMS keeps dwindling.....
What was once the spoils of very shrewd but fair dealings in surplus electronics and worth a few 10's of thousands of dollars and a pretty good collection of tools and fixtures that someday would be used to open a service related and electronics repair shop/business has been reduced to empty boxes, packing materials and empty tool kits.
Of course to the casual observer from the front mostly blocked off view the units looked full of stuff that someday would make us financially independent again after many health issues and life getting in the way....

BUT HERE IS THE RUB... 
I get a once in a lifetime awesome opportunity to clear out a bunch of amazing parts, pennies on the dollar, and guilt free because the guy is happy to sell all his stuff to someone who is going to really appreciate it and use it to change his life!
And what do you know, for the first time in many years fate lends a hand and makes available the ONLY OTHER 10 X 30 storage UNIT in the whole damn place right next to ours!
Of course I want it, it's perfect, it's convenient and what do you know.........
THE FUCKING CEILING IS OPEN AND GIVES UNINTERUPTED 24 HOURS A DAY ACCESS INTO BOTH MY OTHER UNITS!!!!!!!!!!
And, the lock on the door has been relocated slightly up and left of its original location so that when locked..... Wait for it......... No really, this is good.........
You can simply lift the door and close it behind you and NO ONE CAN TELL ANYONE IS IN THERE!!!!!!
GET IT?!?!!? BECAUSE IT STILL APPEARS TO BE LOCKED!!!!!
So all the signs I reported, all the little things that I said made me think maybe someone was going over the wall.....
It all adds up.
I think they not only knew I was right, I believe the storage unit people themselves were in on it.
And I think the plan was to make that spot available to me so that I would move a whole bunch of really expensive stuff in that unit which butts right up against their office storage unit, which coincidentally now has a fresh pile of sheetrock dust under what I can only assume it's another hole in the ceiling and which now has had its locked relocated.
I discovered the lock had been relocated on the unit that we just rented two and a half months ago. For all I know it's been that way for years and I just noticed it.
Unit came available the day after I asked them if they had any emergency space I can put some stuff into temporarily.
I set up a whole damn sting operation thinking I was so smart....
I have pictures of the fascia on the front of the building being bent and changed daily almost in the last few weeks. In a weird coincidence because I was taking pictures of the front of the building trying to figure out how they were getting in before, and going back 2 years, I can tell that its changed over time because that's where they crawl across once in the ceiling....
When played in a fast slide show, you can see it moving like somebody crawling through it....
I called the cops to come down and check out the faked lock door, they wouldn't lift the door they said that it looked like it was locked to them, I said okay I'll lift it...told me I'd be arrested, that would be breaking and entering.
I had lifted it before they got there. I'm looking at my own shelves they took, moved through that ceiling piece by piece, not with any of my stuff on them, but other peoples stuff... I don't know who that belonged too.
Storage unit company of course won't tell me who rented that unit.
I think it was one of their own employees.
Someone they assure me still works there but I haven't seen since.
I can't file a police report. No obvious signs of forced entry.
Can't file an insurance claim with no police report.
Now I'm going through the other units and realizing I don't have anything of worth left in there either...
I spent $10,000 storing what I thought was tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff 4 years and I have nothing to show for it.
And not only is this a rampant problem in this storage location....
But every storage unit. His first online in Oregon at least is having similar if not the very same problems.
Calling around to other storage units and finding previous employees of this storage unit working there is not making me feel any better about the situation....
And the fact that the state of Oregon passed a law that allows these people to force us to pay for their insurance in order to rent space there is not making me feel very good about that either.
So many people are complaining about this online every one of them saying they've been to the cops I cannot believe that the police department's don't know exactly what's going on here.
I would be willing to bet you money if you have a storage unit in Oregon not all of your stuff is in there the way you think you left it...
We have a new manager I take her down to my unit I explained all this, showed her some of my most damning evidence and ask her what she's going to do for me.
Haven't heard from her since....
"
386,"I can confirm this absolutely worked for me. Comcast decided to charge me after I cancelled my plan. A simple claim got me connected to a top executive in my region and got the issue resolved quickly.


These people will suddenly start to care as soon as you complain. "
387,"I think the most annoying thing I've had happen is a $25 charge for ""cleaning"" the drip tray on the stove. Pissed me off. When I move out of a place, I'm obsessive about cleaning it to be near immaculate. I want every cent back with minimal hassle from the landlord. So for something incredibly stupid like that-- I put up a fight. A threat to go to small claims court resolved it in five minutes. $25 is cheaper than the effort and costs of going to court "
388,"Receipts help, too.

I moved into a one bedroom apartment and none of the windows had blinds. I bought blinds for all windows and spent hours hanging them (I'm not handy). 

Two years later I move put and ask the property manager if he wants me to take them down or leave them there. ""Leave them."" Okay, cool.

A week later I get the deposit back less half. The itemized list has a bunch of small BS things that you just expect the manager to charge, but that came out to 1/8th the difference. The big charge? Blinds.

I call up that asshat and he says ""well, you guys destroyed them,"" not true, ""so we need to replace them.""

I told him, via email, that since I bought the blinds and still have the receipt that I'll be picking up my blinds and taking him to small claims court for my deposit. He called me right away to tell me that I'll be getting my deposit back.

I was a thorn in the manager's side, though. They tried pulling all sorts of shady shit on the tenants, mostly the other tenants, and I fought back everything they tried pulling on us."
389,"Ugh, so true! 

When I moved in, the lead handyman was trying to get the apartment filled for the owner. He asked if we had a car so they could put the plate number on the lease so they have our info. We said no car  now but the guy said whenever we get it, we can just add it. That’s there’s no charge. Lead handyman signed our lease, so I assumed he was our manager “Jesus”.

We got our car and put our car in the empty parking spot. A neighbor comes up claiming it’s his spot, but we noticed he had 3 spots since some tenants didn’t have cars/parked on the street. I called the office and an office guy “Jess” said no, that’s our spot and “jess”  supposedly added it to our information. 

A year later, our car breaks down so we leave it in our spot and have another car on the street. A new manager named “Rebecca” says according to the lease, old car must be in working condition to stay on the lot. (Remember, our physical lease still says 0 car, but I’m assuming speaking from the office guy and new manager requesting me to move it according to lease, that’s my spot.)

Unfortunately my son deleted my emails on my phone but I only have one email left that I sent new manager “Rebecca” saying, “thank you very much for letting me know, I’ll be moving the car in 3 week, waiting for the dmv to allow me to drop off the car”


A year later, a new manager “Lucy”  is claiming that since the car spot isn’t in our lease, the owner of the building wants to charge us $50+ unless I can prove that the office said I can have that spot. He claiming since we’re a studio apartment, that he’s charging us for that. 

What sucks is I’m good neighbors with the 3 other studio tenants and none are getting charged for space. 

So yeah, get everything in writing!. I’m not even sure if that email is good or too vague for a claim. "
390,"> complaint to BBB

PSA: The Better Business Bureau is a bunch of scammers and extortionists. They give your business an A+ rating if you pay the membership fee, no questions asked. And not paying your protection money means they'll give you a lower score and won't investigate false complaints.

They profit from consumers who think the BBB is a government agency (they're not) and from scummy business owners who want a good rating without having to actually earn it.

My advice? Go to your local chamber of commerce and file a complaint. They'll actually do something.

Further reading: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Business_Bureau#Criticism"
391,"I run a small business and the BBB contacted me shortly after I got my business license.  They are basically paid advertising for businesses (pay a small fee, get an A+ rating)

The BBB really has no teeth for enforcement.  Most companies want to do what’s right though, sometimes the complaint just has to get to the right level to where someone can act outside of “protocol”

How BBB complaints are handled is 100% up to the integrity of the company though."
392,"I've no experience with trying to dispute a charge on a debit card, but my understanding is that the major difference between the chargeback processes on credit/debit cards is that on a debit card the bank will give you your money back after they've concluded the investigation (which can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks), with a credit card, they immediately remove the disputed amount from your balance so it doesn't affect your available credit and you're not charged interest on it.  So, in terms of cash flow, credit card chargebacks are much preferable.  I think it's generally also easier to initiate a dispute on a credit card.

I'm super particular about who I'll give my debit card information to (usually, only use it at ATMs if I need cash) because if someone steals my card info then I'm probably out whatever cash they steal for at least a couple of weeks.  Credit cards is a non-issue.

As well, credit cards typically earn you some sort of rewards with each purchase.  Might as well get something for spending your money.  IMO the only real reason not to use a CC for everything is if you A) can't get one, or B) would be irresponsible with one."

The HFs got some fancy illusions, but thats all they are. Some fancy tricks, mind fuckery and slander.

 Like some high school peer pressure bullying bullshit, only instead of your lunch money they're going after your investments (which for a lot of us isn't a whole lot more proportionally, myself included). 

In my experience, bullys cover their fear with threats. Thats what this all is right now. EMPTY THREATS. They are desperate and scared cause now the whole playground is on to them and they about to get their asses WHOOPED!

They're acting like we never took a hit before, like we're scared of a little scuffle cause they don't live in the streets we grew up on. They're SCARED of being broke and eating ramen daily to make ends meet. MOTHER FUCKERS DONT KNOW WE ALREADY THERE LIVING IT! 

They saw fearlessness last week and are trying to break us of that. What they don't get is that we aren't fearless, WE ARE JUST RETARDED AND STOCKS GO BRRRRR!! 

Its courage they see, my fellow autists, and these scared lil bitches don't get it. 

We don't see each other behind our screens and monitors but I see the numbers and they don't lie. We are together, I am here with you all and you with me. The WORLD is with us.  Even my wife's boyfriend Brad is with us and he only eats the yellow crayons (which as we all know is the worst flavor).

We've got some real diamond hands here boys, apes that have literally seen MILLIONS in loss and they are STILL HERE! So grab your fucking balls, quit your bitching, and stock up on these juicy dips cause the HF assholes thought a DISCOUNT SALE was gonna have you running away!

394,"Hey, since apparently even *the news* is reporting on what our bots do/don't do and acting like what we're doing is some reaction to GME, this is what's actually going on.

Most subreddits use a rule like ""You can't talk unless your account is over 30 days old"", but there are spammer that have accounts that are ancient, slightly aged, and everything in between.

We decided to go with ""The first time you comment or submit it will be removed and you'll have to have 30 days elapse before you can freely post"", with some caveats.

**For comments**:

A) You, as a new user, can comment on threads whose flair is  'Weekend Discussion', 'Daily Discussion', 'Discussion Thread'. 

B) You *can't* reply to other people's submissions.

**For submissions**:

A) You can't submit unless it's a Gain/Loss/YOLO that follows the rules

B) You can submit DD

The intention is to make people lurk for a while before they can just post willy nilly. A lot of people were getting upset and pointing to DD from new users that didn't get through so I made an exception for DD.

Believe it or not, a lot of those commenters on your submissions are people that have been here for a while.

I know it kinda sucks and I'm sorry especially if you're an oldbro that got caught in the filter because you didn't talk at the right time before we turned it on, but I'm doing the best I can to keep things somewhat normal."
395,"This’ll be buried hardcore, but OP, could you point users to the sub rules and community guidelines. I know there’s been a lot of vitriol on both sides (new users and vets) but half of it is from a shitload of people shitting in the living room. As things chill out, I’m positive the mods will start brining y’all back into the fold. A lot of this is massive growth that was not only unexpected (to some degree we are kinda like the red headed bastard children of Reddit), but it compounds matters when the sub is FLOODED with posts that don’t meet community guidelines.

Q: “But BlueFalcon, you are a worthless piece of shit, and not even a mod, why should we listen to you???”

A: cause I too follow the rules...

Q: “even the gain/loss/yolo rules with a 2.5k limit?”

A: yes, even those, cause before the GME run up, I also was poor and couldn’t post in those categories. I read and stuck to the daily threads for my shitposting.

Q: “what about those bastards, who paper handed like a bitch, like you, can I downvote them to oblivion?”

A: if you want to, but some of us actually have good advice. Some of us have blown up our small PP accounts numerous times trying to catch our break from being poor too. Learn from idiots like me (IE- what not to do) and seek out the smart ones who actually make money.

Also, I will troll the fuck outta you if you keep doing it."

397,"^^^ that's exactly how the market works. that's why you also can't put too much faith into the number you see when the volume is low or the available shares are thin. The number becomes very erratic and flies around with a massive spread (difference between buy and sell)

It's basically a waiting game at this point. They make money when they push to zero. They can use that money to further push to zero.

However eventually the people that they borrowed the shares from, are going to call them and demand either interest or coverage in full.

And we're pretty close to the coverage in full. The fact that they're now implementing the uptick rule, and the fact that most of the paper hands have been shaken, now it's just going to be the margin calls we have to deal with. But if everybody just manages their account properly, it's looking pretty good in my non financial opinion.

414,"My husband sent these people around $1500. At a time when we really, really needed it. I mean, we always need it, but we were particularly hard up at that time. I begged him not to. I’d been audited before and KNEW how the IRS communicated and operated when you owed them money. He did it anyway. He wired them the money in two separate payments. Couldn’t afford it all at once. I’m still kinda sore about it. It’s one thing to be duped, we’re all human. But I was spelling out and screaming “This. Is. A. Scam!” the entire time. But I’m glad to at least know that those responsible are being held accountable. "
415,"A year ago I got a call from one of them and I pressed the number to get connected with an ""agent"".

416,"Ive always assumed the only people who fall for these scams are the elderly or mentally challenged but recently I had an acquaintance who is a doctor....A DOCTOR!, scammed into buying $4,000 worth of iTunes cards and sending the information to the scammer.

417,"People need to be more aware and informed.  Being in cryptocurrency I see people get scammed all the time...you have to be vigilant with your money. A lot of scams try to make you act quickly which can be the first tip off, especially one such as the IRS Scam that literally states you'll be jailed if you don't.

Anything with checks being given to you to buy items, or buying prepaid cards are more than likely scams as well.

Also, Kitboga does gods work by contacting scammers and not only waste massive amounts of their time, but also is a great resource to figure out how these things work.

Unfortunately a lot of older people fall for these things because they aren't familiar with technology.  At the very least most people should ask around/look online if something sounds scammy - even online retailers. "
418,"Exactly this. I've been getting daily spoofed phone calls that often leave automated voice messages in Mandarin for about a year now despite me being pretty discreet with my cell number. So much so that anytime I get a fraud protection call from my CU, I call them back and make sure everything is legitimate, instead of just calling back the number the robot provides and giving away my PIN/DOB/Account number. It's a little bit more of a hassle, but you can't really trust that it is actually your bank/credit union that made the initial call in the first place.

I also got a couple of calls ""from the IRS"" in the past saying that I owe money and even have multiple arrest warrants *(I don't lol)*. 

A couple years back there was a woman that called from a US number with a thick Indian/Pakistani accent *(she said her name was something like Maria Martinez)* and told me that there's a warrant for my arrest for money owed to the IRS and that there have been a couple of attempts by the police to arrest me at my house. The really interesting and spooky part was that she actually had my correct address, which again, I don't make a habit of plastering all over on top of having my full name and address. I told her that she can send as many cops to my house as she wants, then asked her to go fuck herself and then called the local sherrif's office to report the issue and the number. They were aware of it. The hoardes of cops never came lol.

**Moral of the story, I guess is don't give out your number/private info unless you either trust the company or are willing to inevitably get your information leaked.** Don't give away any info to any retailer, because that's the most likely place where it'll get leaked. Don't give any real info to your local pharmacy, your grocery store or a shoe store, because it will get out *(or more than likely sold)*.

430,"As someone who turned a 4 digit investment in a ""meme"" coin into a 6 figure amount. **The important thing is being able to tell the difference between a community driven crypto, and a meme coin.** Doge is community driven. Hoge is community driven. Safemoon is community driven. A community driven coin is going to make you fucking rich. A memecoin with a small shill-based community is going to pump and dump and make you sad.

This subreddit as a whole has an irrational bias against meme coins. Do not be like them. Nobody puts their favorite water or electricity company logo as their facebook avatar. They put their favorite sports mascot. Community crypto will not be going anywhere, ever. Utility coins can die overnight when their utility is rendered obsolete by newer tech.

Do not invest in meme coins. Invest in community driven coins. They look alike, but there is a huge difference. This is the ""DYOR"" factor on ""meme"" coins, investigate the community surrounding it."
431,"Do you mean four or five years ago? A quick look at the charts shows that 2300 -> 1200000 is impossible unless you go much further back than 4-5 months. That or he used a lot of leverage.

I’ve seen a lot of claims of Dogecoin millionaires lately, or people who know a guy who knows a guy who became a Dogecoin millionaire. It’s important to remember that to be a Doge millionaire you’d either need to have invest thousands many years ago, or invested tens or hundreds of thousands recently."
432,"Without using emotion, using your brain only: pick a multiple to have as your goal.

For example, let's say you put in $100 and pick a multiple goal of 5x. That means if you see yourself hit $500, that's when it's time to sell. Don't get greedy. Stick to what you told yourself you'd do.

A 5x multiple is **very** respectable. Yes you've seen examples of something going 10,000x. But that's not you.

One last note:

Let's say you put in $100 and then made gains. Whether it ends up being worth $300 or $1000 or any number: when you've hit that amount of profit, withdraw 2x your original investment, and turn it back into fiat.

For example:

You put in $100. Its value goes up to $300. You withdraw $200, and turn it back into cash. Now you've doubled your investment, *and* you still have $100 invested. On the investment side of things, you're only back to where you started (which is a great place to be). I then like to look at that investment as ""free money""."

He reads how coins are able to be sent and received by sending said coins to other peoples addresses. Now he starts digging even deeper on the research and starts reading about privacy coins like Monero which can’t be tracked and realizes they can be sent anonymously. And he sees that some sites offer the ability to convert other coins into Monero.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

442,"Flawed analogy. Melvin could just return $200 to every person he borrowed it from, apologize, and avoid his parents bankruptcy. 

A better analogy would be this: 

Melvin borrows 200 Nintendo switches from his school friends, promising them to return each a  brand new Nintendo switch and also give them a $10 GameStop gift card. Melvin heard from his brother, who works at the local GameStop that they were getting 200 new Nintendo switches. Melvin’s brother got Melvin a $50 off coupon for an unlimited number of consoles. 

So, Melvin collects 200 consoles from his friends and sells them on eBay for $190 each. He pockets $38,000 and pays $4,000 in fees to eBay plus $1,000 to cover shipping costs. Now Melvin has $33,000 that he plans to use to buy 200 new consoles from GameStop at $150 each, which would cost Melvin $30,000. Melvin also promised a $10 gift card to every kid he borrowed the game console from, so that would be another $2,000. Melvin’s is sure he will pocket $1,000 in profit. 

The rest of your story would work."
443,"One correction to your expanded example.

Selling a borrowed Switch would be a short sell, but not a naked short.  A naked short would be selling a Switch that you can't actually borrow.

Imagine you sell the 150 Switches and collect the money before you take delivery from the high schoolers.  When you go to pick up the Switches, you discover that there are only 100 available.  Now you have the country club parents mad at you because you can't deliver the Switch.  That would be a naked short because you have sold Switches you can't procure.  

Another, legal, way to get to 150% float is the following.  You borrow 100 Switches and sell all 100.  50 of the recipients decided they didn't want the Switch and sold them back to the high schoolers.  You then borrow the 50 ""extra"" Switches and sell them to more country club parents.  Now there are only 100 Switches in circulation, but you owe 150 Switches back to the high schoolers.

To resolve the shortages, you buy back 10 Switches and return them to the high schoolers.  With the price of Switches so high, the high schoolers sell them for a nice profit.  Repeat this 15 times, and you have finally paid back all of the Switches.  However, everyone LIKES THE SWITCH.  They are all playing Minecraft,  loving that 💎 armor.  With each batch, it becomes harder and harder to find 10 people willing to sell.  Now they have discovered 🚀 League. You have to keep paying more and more to find someone that will agree to the price.  Next thing you know, everyone is playing Super Mario Galaxy and, the Switch prices are to the moon."

445,"OP left out an important aspect. Every day that Melvin can't get hold of the Switches the parents have already paid for, he has to pay a forfeit to each parent for their trouble of waiting for them. And the more expensive these Switches get on the market, the higher the forfeit, because these parents should by rights already have these Switches, regardless of how expensive they've gotten. Melvin tries to put off paying the higher market price as long as possible in the hopes that it will eventually go down. Eventually the forfeits become so large, Melvin has no choice but to swallow his just desserts and just pay market price for the Switches.

447,"from [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) \-

A limit order is a type of [order](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/basics-trading-stock-know-your-orders/)  to purchase or sell a security at a specified price or better. For buy  limit orders, the order will be executed only at the limit price or a  lower one, while for sell limit orders, the order will be executed only  at the limit price or a higher one. This stipulation allows traders to  better control the prices they trade.

By using a buy limit order, the [investor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp) is guaranteed to pay that price or less. While the price is guaranteed, the [filling](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fill.asp) of  the order is not, and limit orders will not be executed unless the  security price meets the order qualifications. If the asset does not  reach the specified price, the order is not filled and the investor may  miss out on the trading opportunity.

This can be contrasted with a market order, whereby a trade is executed at the prevailing market price without any price limit specified.

1. We all panic sell, and crash the stock. Really? After working in concert for weeks? 

2. We withdraw slowly each selling a few shares at a time. People with 1 share will get out at the top. People with thousands will sell some shares at the top.

Eventually only big share holders are left, and have sold a percentage at a profit, and small investors are out safely. 

3. The Gamestop CEO uses this opportunity to remake the company into the next Amazon or Tesla, and we are in at the ground floor of a new era.

I'm hoping for 3. We just gave him a second chance, i hope he takes it.

>Around January 2019, a user known as u/1R0NYMAN sold a box spread creating a $300,000 credit that should have netted him from $40,000-$50,000 over the course of 2 years. He described the trade as a way to make ""**risk-free money**"", but he was unaware of the assignment risk.

458,"Howdy all!

Been considering jumping in with you on a few highly shorted stocks just for fun; overall I'm a traditional buy-and-hold in the medium to long term guy but there's a tidal wave of change happening.  For some perspective for newbies:

Big hedge funds **borrow** shares of companies they consider ""overvalued;"" that is, likely to drop in price because of  poor fundamentals, lousy management, changing technology, whatever (think about the Blockbuster Video rental chain if you're old enough).  Many people, including me, think that GameStop also has lousy fundamentals and a broken business model.  When is the last time YOU bought a game there??

If/when those comanies' shares drop in value, the hedgies can buy them at a low price and ""cover"" their short position and pocket the difference in stock price from where they borrowed to where they cover.  This is classically known as ""shorting"" or ""selling short"" a stock.  

If the value of those companies instead goes **up**, the hedgies have to at some point repay the owners of the stocks they borrowed with shares bought at a higher price (so they lose money - the higher the price they have to buy at, the more they lose).  Their downside is limitless - if a share goes from $10 to $1000 and they are forced to cover, they have lost 100x what they put in.  At some point a fund gets out because it can't afford to lose any more (again, unlimited downside), which is what started happening with Gamestop (GME) last week.  

GameStop (GME), as a highly shorted stock, was/is a great target for WSB to focus on as it was highly shorted.  Hedge funds who bought the stock at a low price have been forced to ""cover"" their positions at a much higher price.  Because of all the retail investors (us) were buying, there weren't many shares around to borrow, so the hedgies had to buy no matter what the price (a ""short squeeze"").

BUT, think about this: it's all a game of chicken.  If a hedge fund has unlimited cash on hand, it will short GME **even more** now, because of it's meteoric rise.  A year ago, with GME trading at 4 dollars a share (yes, really), all a hedgie could make was MAX $4.00 per share, IF the company's stock went all the way to zero, which virtually never happens.  Now, if another hedge fund decides to jump in and short GME at $400, it's upside, or potential profit, is **up to $400/share**.  This is the ultimate catnip: the higher the share price, the more money that shorting it can make IF it goes down.  This also means that for retail investors (that is, you and me), buying here has a lot of both potential upside (if more hedge funds are forced to cover) and downside (if the hedge funds can hold out and keep shorting until it goes down)."

Shorting, volume and supply can cause catastrophic results especially if everyone decides fuck this I am taking my cash out the banking system. Look at this from wiki - sounds familiar:

Augustus' brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.[19]
To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, president of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding.[20] Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.[21]
The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the New York Stock Exchange, literally an outdoor market ""on the curb"" (this curb market would later become the American Stock Exchange). After the crash, The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market"".[22]

Contagion spreadsEdit

The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.
F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time,[23] by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests.[24] By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.[25]
A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the Pittsburgh city's stock exchange closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907"

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears — Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that 🚀🚀🚀.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the 🚀, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their 🍌🍌🍌 for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

**10:12 Update**

🦍🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but 🍌🍌🍌 for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

So the shorts available have not changed according to IBorrowDesk. What this means is that the SHITs are getting their shorts from somewhere else, or the 500,000 that were borrowed in pre-market were held back until the lunch attack. This way, the number on IBorrowDesk doesn't change right after the drop, so it can look like it wasn't them. I'm willing to bet money that a good portion if not all of those 500,000 shorts were used during the lunch attack.

GME is recovering from that blast and is making it's way back towards 300. We'll see if the trajectory has changed after the attack.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 278.96

**Update 1:46**

GME had been floating around 270, however another 50,000 shorts were borrowed. This might explain the dip down to below 260. The volatility seems to have evened out enough for this to make sense. Please realize that regardless of where GME ends up today, 750,000 shorts were fired at GME today, and the price is still up 8% from yesterday's close. They are at 150,000 shorts left. They are running out of ammo and GME is still climbing. We might be reaching the end game.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 266.65

**2:20 Update**

Downward momentum lately pushing below 250. It was stable around 265 for a good bit. This might be another short attack. 

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 236.70

**3:00 Update**

GME dropped down to around 225 before starting it's slow recovery back up. This might be an attack from remnants from the shorts borrowed earlier today. We're not seeing drops in shorts available. With this post being popular, the SHITers might be onto how we gather information on their moves and are trying to mask their intentions. I'm pretty sure there is math available where we can figure out the short to price change ratio to be able to figure out how many shorts they fire during a short attack. I'm going to think on this and see if I can figure out a process to figure this out. I'm pretty sure it's doable, but probably involves some complicated math.

If we can figure out that equation, we would be able to estimate how many shorts are being pumped into GME on every attack. We can then figure out how much ammo they truly have left.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 257.72

516,"I'm going to level with everyone here. I'm not an investor. I took $120 two years ago, bought $AMD stock because I liked the stock and had a hunch their 3rd gen Ryzen, Epyc, and Radeon GPU's would help them continue to steal Intel/Nvidia market share.

I was right and that $120 turned into $386 after 18 months. That stock has been pretty stagnant compared to the gains I was getting (I'm now reading $AMD might be getting shorted which is the reason it's growth has halted, but don't get distracted, $GME is all we like right now), but I was still ahead. I heard about the $GME hype from my brother-in-law who, sadly, bought at about $30/share and sold when it hit $90. A great return, but man if he could have held. He's back in now, but at a much higher cost.

I don't go to the casino that often, but when I do, about $100 is the most I'm willing to lose, and I do *play to lose*. Gambling is entertainment, not a business (unless you own the house). My husband and I make comfortable money for the area we live in. If I can make that $100 last me 1 or 2 hours, I consider that a major win, and the loss just means a little less goes into savings that month, or maybe I don't buy the special edition game and just get the base edition.

So, despite *wanting* to make bank, if $GME does keep dropping and the short squeeze really is over like the news outlets want us to believe (it's not), well, that's $120 of gambling money I made last two years. That's a win in my book. The fact that there is this giant community that will experience the same thing as me just makes the whole effort worth it in my book.

TL;DR, if I can make a huge profit, I'm going to sell. If I lose it all, which I understand is far, far less then what many people have in (1 share at $350.11), I'll consider the two years of gambling with the same $120 totally worth it.

For anyone curious, my current investment, which once peaked at a 222.17% increase over 18 months, has dropped to a 14.94% increase over the same time period since cashing out $AMD and buying $GME. But I'm having fun and the ticket price is well worth the ride."

536,"Credit u/PlayFree_Bird

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

545,"A piece of advice, I wouldn't put the Crock-Pot vessel/container into the refrigerator overnight and pull it out and start a cook. The insert is generally ceramic, the temperature change going from that cold to the heat added is a good way to get cracks into it. (Been there, done that). Pre-prepare and put into a large ziplock (or multiple) and toss into the container in the morning and start it.

I don't much use my slowcooker anymore as most recipes come out pretty same-y. I used it for making salsa chicken (chicken breasts/thighs + jar of salsa + taco seasoning, cook, shred, toss back into mixture to soak it up)."
546,"I tell this to literally everyone I know. **A CROCKPOT IS THE BEST LIFE INVESTMENT YOU *CAN* AFFORD.** I seriously make so much in it that I can take to work for at least three days. Hell I had crockpot chicken and noodles last week, two servings on two different days because I was starving, and it lasted me 2 lunches and 3 dinners. My god.

"
548,"Then again, do you turn off the AC/heat and all electronics as well?  A crockpot doesn't get hot enough to start a fire.  It's more along the lines of keeping your TV on standby mode so that you can flip it on with the remote control--I bet you do this already without a second thought."
549,"Dr pepper is surprisingly useful in marinades. I'm a big fan of soy sauce, fish sauce and tamarind when I'm stir frying meat. A splash of Dr pepper really cuts the salt and vinegar of those and brings a nice bit of sweetness, while also tenderizing meat. "

551,"Honestly, crock pots are good, but pressure cookers is where it's at. 

Don't get me wrong, crock pots are good, but they take too long. If planning and preparation is the main contributor to eating out, then it doesn't help in that regard.

A pressure cooker has all the same advantages but compressed into 20-40 minutes. 

1. They cost about the same, or if you want to splurge, you can get a crock pot/pressure cooker combo (but they cost more).

2. They are very fast, so you can still use those cheap cuts of meat to make stews for example, but in 30 mins instead of 2 hours.  Same goes for certain veggies and stuff that can take a long time (dried beans, that kind of thing). 

3. It expands the possible repertoire of dishes you can prepare in 30-40 minutes to include things that would normally take a couple hours or more. 

4. They are usually pretty big, so you can prep several days worth of food. 

5. I find the texture of the resulting meal to be better since you can pressure cook the meat and sauce, and then add in vegetables at the end so they don't overcook and turn to mush. 

6. You can use it like a normal pot if you don't want to use the pressure valve. 

So if you're reading this and thinking ""8 hours? Ain't nobody got time for that!"" you should look into pressure cookers. "
552,A pressure cooker does that faster and better
553,"Second this.  A sous vide will turn a cheap cut of meat to the sublime.  It excels at pork roasts.  And you don't know how good an ear of corn tastes until you've sous vide'd it.  

My daughter just moved out.  I told her, you can have whatever kitchen stuff you want - take the rice cooker, the cast iron, the crockpot, my clay pot, whatever, but not the sous vide.  You will pry my sous vide out of my cold, dead hands.  "
554,"It really is. Hmm. I never got a recipe online I made it from my own experiments but I am sure you could google something similar to the below. I have been meaning to write this down somewhere anyway. 

• a lot of chicken. I like at least 6 breasts to compare to the proportions of the rest of this recipe but I’ve done ten before. Yum! Chop them up beforehand of course. I cut them in very small pieces because it’s easier to eat when you don’t have to worry about saving big chicken bites. 
• two normal size cans of tomato sauce or diced tomatoes. I like diced more since it provides a touch more texture. I get big cans at Costco so I only need one big one. I believe that comes out to 29 to 30 oz. 
• one chopped onion Pretty finely chopped I use one of those enclosed choppers to avoid tears and make it easy. Worth buying. 
• use the same cutter for 4 garlic cloves finely chopped
• a crap ton of spices, basically all to taste. This comes with how you like it! A rule of thumb is about 1-2 Tbsp per spice. I never measure this out myself.  If you don’t have any of the below you could probably skip any one thing except the Garam masala, which any Asian style store will have for very, very cheap.  
- Garam Masala (need a good amount of this for the distinct masala earthy taste. Yum!) I would do two tablespoons of this. 
- cayenne pepper (depends on spice preferences but less is more, probably). I’ve done less than one tablespoon to probably four and it’s all been good but best to start with one max. 
- Black pepper. I probably go lighter side of this too. Max 1 tbsp, but even less isn’t a bad idea. 
- paprika (smoky taste. Delicious. Also recommend 2 tbsp.)
- only a little bit of cinnamon. Probably two teaspoons max. Not even. 
- cumin. I would do in between one and two tablespoons of this if you measure out. 
- coriander. I can’t imagine you need much of this. I’d go slightly less than a Tbsp. 
- turmeric. This is the not so secret ingredient but it’s super important. Delicious. Be careful when using it because this will get under your fingernails and get in your floors or cabinets. It gets everywhere but this stuff is so important! I do at least two tablespoons but likely go over. I probably do something like three tablespoons of this. 
- roasted ground ginger. This is a spice I hadn’t heard of it but it’s not expensive and literally got it at my local giant. Two tbsp.  
- I don’t like to add salt because I can add to taste. More on that later. 
So put everything above in a big bowl or the actual slow cooker. Stir so Chicken is evenly covered & the color is even. The orange turmeric should be coming out very clearly to give it a light orange or bright red color. Then put this in the slow cooker, put 3-4 bay leaves on top & cook for 8 hours or 4 on high. Come back to it. It should smell delicious & look darker than when you put it in! Take bay leaves out and add a can of coconut milk or you can put half and half in. This will lighten the color significantly. Whatever liquid you use should be 1.5 cups, give or take. One can of the coconut milk I buy is 13.66 oz so right over 1.5 cups and it is perfect.  Put it back on for about thirty mins and viola! You will have a freaking amazing meal ready.  My dad recommended adding corn starch to thicken it (making it like the above right from the crock will make it pretty thin for typical masala, but it thickens as it stays in the fridge) but I’m not a fan of using that to thicken something that will come to on its own.  Then make rice and whenever you serve, use the rice as a bed and pour the masala over.  Keep in mind that the spices and tomatoes will stain any plastic container you put it in so invest in glass meal prep containers or be ready to have stained Tupperware.  I used to spread rice and this broth across individual glass containers and it worked really well. 

The real secret is to get plain goat cheese (Costco has proprietary goat cheese which is perfect) and drop a couple of spoonfuls into the pan while heating up the masala. I swear to god it’s like magic; it thickens the broth, gives it a creamy texture, adds a salty taste (don’t need to add table salt anywhere) while suppressing some of the spice (for folks who don’t like spice) & gives the classic orange color.  I get these stonefire mini naan flatbreads at Costco and put one in the toaster while I’m heating up the masala. Eat the chicken/rice by itself with a fork and then use the naan to soak the leftover harder to eat parts of the broth and rice. Try to put in a deep but low-diameter plate to easily maneuver the naan.  I promise this will pack so much flavor in every bite it blows your mind. I eat this a lot and I never get tired of it.  You can also put cold goat cheese crumbled on the side and add to your naan to make a mini sandwich bite instead of heating it into the masala.

- **paprika** (smoky taste. Delicious. Also recommend 2 tbsp.)
- only a little bit of **cinnamon**. Probably two teaspoons max. Not even. 
- **cumin**. I would do in between one and two tablespoons of this if you measure out. 
- **coriander**. I can’t imagine you need much of this. I’d go slightly less than a Tbsp. 
- **turmeric**. This is the not so secret ingredient but it’s super important. Delicious. Be careful when using it because this will get under your fingernails and get in your floors or cabinets. It gets everywhere but this stuff is so important! I do at least two tablespoons but likely go over. I probably do something like three tablespoons of this. 
- **roasted ground ginger**. This is a spice I hadn’t heard of it but it’s not expensive and literally got it at my local giant. Two tbsp.  
- I don’t like to add salt because I can add to taste. More on that later. 

So put everything above in a big bowl or the actual slow cooker. Stir so **Chicken** is evenly covered & the color is even. The **orange turmeric** should be coming out very clearly to give it a light orange or bright red color. Then put this in the slow cooker, put **3-4 bay leaves** on top & cook for **8 hours or 4 on high**. 

Come back to it. It should smell delicious & look darker than when you put it in! Take bay leaves out and add a **can of coconut milk** or you can put half and half in. This will lighten the color significantly. Whatever liquid you use should be 1.5 cups, give or take. One can of the coconut milk I buy is 13.66 oz so right over 1.5 cups and it is perfect.  Put it back on for about **thirty mins** and viola! You will have a freaking amazing meal ready.  

My dad recommended adding corn starch to thicken it (making it like the above right from the crock will make it pretty thin for typical masala, but it thickens as it stays in the fridge) but I’m not a fan of using that to thicken something that will come to on its own.  

Then make **rice** and whenever you serve, use the rice as a bed and pour the masala over.  Keep in mind that the spices and tomatoes will stain any plastic container you put it in so invest in glass meal prep containers or be ready to have stained Tupperware.  I used to spread rice and this broth across individual glass containers and it worked really well. 

The real secret is to get **plain goat cheese** (Costco has proprietary goat cheese which is perfect) and drop a couple of spoonfuls into the pan while heating up the masala. I swear to god it’s like magic; it thickens the broth, gives it a creamy texture, adds a salty taste (don’t need to add table salt anywhere) while suppressing some of the spice (for folks who don’t like spice) & gives the classic orange color.  I get these stonefire mini naan **flatbreads** at Costco and put one in the toaster while I’m heating up the masala. Eat the chicken/rice by itself with a fork and then use the naan to soak the leftover harder to eat parts of the broth and rice. Try to put in a deep but low-diameter plate to easily maneuver the naan.  I promise this will pack so much flavor in every bite it blows your mind. I eat this a lot and I never get tired of it.  You can also put cold goat cheese crumbled on the side and add to your naan to make a mini sandwich bite instead of heating it into the masala. "
556,"I agree with this. My SO can cook an entire roast with some veggies and such in 45 minutes and it falls apart with a fork. A roast will last us days too. Though, she has to get a new one and there are slow-cooker/pressure cooker combos for ≈50ish on Amazon.

Only bad thing is you kinda have a bomb in the kitchen when one doesn't know what they're doing, hence why she uses it. And I cook pancakes. "
557,"It's the convenience of ""set it and forget it"". You can dump ingredients in the crock, turn it on, leave to go to work, and come home to dinner being ready. 

A lot of people who use crockpots do so because they don't want to come home and cook after a long day. A pressure cooker can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing; a Dutch oven is great if you're home all day. 

I enjoy cooking and I work from home. I still find it more convenient to take 2 minutes and toss some chicken breasts and marinade in the slow cooker and leave it until after work. If my SO comes home and is hungry, he can shred up the chicken and make himself tacos for dinner while I'm on conference calls. "

560,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

564,"I'm going to start repeating this as many times as possible:

FOR  THESE HEDGE FUNDS, LEGALITY IS IRRELEVANT.

ALL THAT MATTERS IS  PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL.

CAPITAL BUYS POLITICIANS, REGULATORS (looking at Yellen), AND LAWYERS TO DELAY AND DIMINISH ANY POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

CAPITAL LETS THEM TRADE $100 BILLION IN LOSSES TODAY FOR A $100 MILLION FINE A YEAR FROM NOW.

BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES AND EXPECT THIS TO FIGHT  TO CONTINUE."
565,"This is maybe the largest scale of stag hunt/prisoners dilemma EVER and its fucking impressive to watch the conviction with which every single person is executing the game theory.

This shit is really insane. A bid of 196 and ask of 5000. Lmao it's unreal."
566,When is the next shareholder meeting? A few days before might be a good day to recall your stock so you can vote
567,I think the reality is most of us aren't shaken. A lot of the comments are just people baiting for downvotes.
568,"A million people arriving independently at the same truth is still uniformity. Uniformity is different from conspiracy. 

I like this stock. Apparently other people do too 🤷‍♂️"
569,Yeah but it kinda feels like it's a bit of column A and a bit of column B on this one.
570,"Reddit's value isn't the code or the site.  Reddit's value is the userbase, and the name.  

It's no different than AOL Instant Messenger back in the early '00s.  AIM was garbage, there were probably 10 other systems that were light years better.  But everybody used AIM.  Why?  Because all their friends were on AIM, and nobody they knew was on (better thing).  

If you want to supplant Reddit, you have to a. duplicate the functionality, and b. attract the content and discussion.  A. is easy, just copy Reddit's open source code from a few years back and start updating it.  B is harder.  People won't move without a reason.  

You could make the thing at least somewhat decentralized; that could at least give people a reason to move in the hope that they wouldn't have to move again.  The problem is who actually moves.  

The people who WILL move quickly are the people you don't want in huge quantity- the crazy wingnuts, the racists, the literal psychos, the 'almost child porn' subs, the incels and femcels and all the others that not even 4chan wants.  That makes it easy for your new system to get a reputation as a bad place.  

Or don't decentralize.  Make a 'reddit but better'.  Problem is, what happens when you grow and someone offers you $10 billion for the site?  Nobody in their right mind would turn that down, and then all the users are in the same boat as before."

575,"1) I'm amazed by all the comments assuming clear legal right / wrong as the only consideration for u/DFV, and not narrative that can be spun to score points
2) I'm discouraged that nobody seems to think some elected officials might consider scoring points with 8 million + of the 99% instead of the 1% if they have enough reason.

SO GIVE THEM A DAMN REASON TO CHOOSE DFV OVER WALL STREET!!!! 

You amazing autists plastered the world with WSB billboards and owned global attention for a week and counting. And now you're fuckin giving up on DFV the guy who offered this freely to every single damn person who was stupid enough to listen??!!

Come on WSB! Let's show the world again, what 💎👐 means beyond stonks! I believe in us!"
576,"A news website found his name, previous employer, previous address, abd some other info and posted it.

He was outed against his will pretty much within the first few days of this blowing up.

At that point there was no benefit to staying hidden."
577,"He doxxed himself like a dummy by going public.  Giving name, city, workplace. 
 Guh. It may or may not have came out eventually but that is so basic. 
   
NO ONE would have blamed him if he cashed out near the top, never posted again and lived a quiet life - which is weird cause that seemed to be the kinda guy he was, not some redneck on the news who just won the lottery.  In fact his legend wouldve grown if he just went dark.  
   
And now he'll forever be know as ""THE MAN WHO TOOK 43 MILLION!"", when its more like a fifth of that after the dust settles and taxes.  A handsome sum for sure but when people think you have 43 million its a whole different game.  

Good luck to my dude.  He made me some cash and for that I'll forever grateful  :)"
578,"I've been thinking about this since this blew up.  Collectively, this site has unimaginable potential.  Think of having a fund that could invest in a variety of businesses from seed stage all the way to public companies.  A lot of good could be achieved as well as profits realized."
579,">Link to NYTimes article

WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT... HOLD THE FUCK ON FOR A SECOND. 

The end of that article says:

 “I am not trying to inhibit anyone’s ability to access the marketplace,” Mr. Galvin said. “The issue here is transparency.”  


The issue is transparency? Fucking transparency?! ON WALLSTREET?! You must be joking. These are the rules for the little guys. These aren't laws or rules enforced on anyone up top. This is the most obfuscated industry there is besides maybe Defense R&D, black book type shit. The idea that all of us rallied behind DFV, and theyre doing this in the interest of transparency, is as laughable as it insulting. This is about a scapegoat, and to punish anyone that stood to benefit from beating the status quo. Thats it."
580,"he's not being summoned, these hearings are voluntary -- he's more being invited. A summons would be a subpeona.

And non-US-citizens and non-US-residents are absolutely allowed to testify before Congress if they want to, see for example Greta Thunberg"
581,A wsb Kickstarter? or shark shark tank? Or a mix
582,"If they really were to throw DFV in jail like you're implying, they would need real solid fucking evidence for it, and if you look at his profile there are legit just daily updates. He's not telling anyone to buy, or hold, or sell, he's started this by himself for himself even when people were telling him that his DD is stupid. 

And even if, absurdly, the 1% make a bunch of shit up and attempt to throw him in jail - they are exactly that. The 1%. A minority. They might have the financial numbers but we have the people number, and they won't just be pissing off Americans, they'll be pissing off the entire world. They can't afford to pull something as fucked up as this in the public eye considering how many people are watching."
583,A lot of companies wouldn’t. Someone with 25 mil in the bank can easily just tell their boss to fuck off and leave at any moment.

594,"Compensation is a mess. A colleague recently left our team to go to a competitor. He received a $20k bump in salary. A few months later, he invited me to come work for them, too. I built a spreadsheet that compared the compensation of both firms. The goal was to determine how much they would need to offer me such that I had the same amount of cash in my pocket (lateral move). The analysis compared salary, 401k contributions, health insurance premiums, maximum out of pocket for healthcare, mobile phone reimbursement, commuting/local travel reimbursement, and paid time off. I learned that in order to move *laterally* their salary offer would need to be at least $30k more than my current job. I would have required more than that. They could not meet the requirement and no offer was made. My friend never did the math and basically changed jobs for less money.  
  
**Lesson: Determine ahead of time what a lateral compensation will be including all benefits that impact your wallet.** There may be qualitative benefits like a Koi Pond and proximity to a nice coffee shop ... but you should know the REAL compensation, not just salary."
595,"A lot of comments here criticise recruiters for being secretive about salary, while advocating being secretive about your own expectations.


My usual answer is: ""I'm looking for (what I actually want + 20%) but job satisfaction is more important to me, so I'm really keen to find out more about the position first.""


I've never had a negative response from that."
596,"I’m going to get downvoted into oblivion, but I will disagree yet another time with all of the “common wisdom” being dispensed in this thread as in all employment threads. I negotiate large contracts for a manufacturer for a living. The approach of people in /r/personalfinance to negotiation is backwards.

First of all, 90% of events that someone would characterize as negotiation failure is, in fact, not negotiation failure at all. At least not in terms of a negotiation “tactics” failure. It generally falls into one of two categories:

1: Knowledge failure.

2: Preparation failure. More technically BATNA failure.

The idea that the negotiation happens in the conference room is, quite simply, wrong. The battle is fought and won *loooooong* before you set foot in that room. I know it may not be glamorous and drama writers may not put it in Suits or Madmen but successful negotiation ultimately comes down to who has the most knowledge and who has the most options.

Let’s talk about knowledge first. The fact that the salary range was a surprise to OP is the LPT. He should have used the myriad research and data out there *before* the interview to construct an at least somewhat precise idea of the average salary for the position. You can’t get it exact, but using data available online it is incredibly easy to arrive at a $15,000 range that will at least largely overlap with the position’s range.

“But what if they’re higher than average? By saying a number first I’m potentially losing money!” If you are basing your employment tactics around charity and luck, you’re doing it incorrectly. You have an opportunity to try and squeeze more out of an offer, which I’ll get into in preparation.

What’s more, you should also know *your* salary. Again, you should be able to get a very good idea of what you’re worth based off of data available online. After that it’s a numbers game. If you apply for jobs that you are qualified for, roughly 250 applications should yield 10 interviews which should yield a job. If you want a job that’s a step up, that conversion ratio gets worse and you have to apply to more. This ties in directly to preparation.

When I begin a negotiation with a potential supplier, they’re not the only supplier I’ll be negotiating with. Not even close. In fact, their price isn’t even the lowest one. I start with the *highest priced* vendor and try and get their price lower than the *lowest priced* vendor. Because by negotiating this way, I always have a BATNA. A BATNA is a Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement. What this means is that if that supplier tells me to go fuck myself, I’m not hurt at all. Not a scratch. They weren’t my lowest offer. Unless, for some reason, it’s impossible (i.e. a monopoly) I never negotiate without a BATNA. Because if they tell me to go fuck myself I have nowhere to go and the results could be potentially catastrophic.

This is how I feel when people here suggest “Well, just ask for 10% more.” As a rule. Okay, what if they say no? Do you walk? Probably not. Take the job and look like an ass, right?

You shouldn’t demand things you’re not willing to walk over. This is why it’s important to have a BATNA, even with jobs. Unless a job manages to really blow away my salary expectations, I generally won’t enter into negotiations for a position unless I have two or three other offers to negotiate with. Yes, that means applying for a ton of jobs and I’m fine with that. So if I have an offer for a combined value of 70k, 65k, and 58k, I can say to the 58k offer “Can you do 72k?” And if they come back with anything over 70, I’ve made progress. Then I ask the 65k to beat that *new* highest offer. If they can’t, throw them out. Again, nothing lost because they weren’t even your highest offer. Finally, you negotiate with the 70k offer and try to get them above the new highest offer.

Rinse and repeat until you can’t get anyone to go up any more and you’ve got your best offer. This is methodical and based on *knowledge* and *preparation*. Whereas “Well, just ask for another 10% no matter what.” And “Never give them a number EVER.” Is based on the gambler’s fallacy and feelings. Sure, you’ll wind up getting 110% of 55k. So it seems like a victory to you. “I got more by doing what these posters are saying to do!”

Sure, I agree that you got 10% more than 55k. But the contention is that if you had employed this industry standard of evidence-based negotiation you could have gotten 100% 70k.

I know it's not glamorous, but real negotiation isn't about bluffs, double-bluffs, clever ruses, tenacity, or who watched Don Draper's scenes the most in the last season and can mimick what they like about his portrayal. It is about knowledge and preparation.

That’s the end of my rant.

597,"This is true.  A job coach told me that if a potential employer asks you what your salary range is to say, ""I know we haven't discussed money yet, but I'm interested to know what your company is offering.""

Hasn't failed yet.  "
598,"This shouldn't even be considered a ""tactic"". Some jobs pay extremely well but have horrendous insurance with crazy premiums and deductibles and offer pretty much the statutory minumum. Other jobs offer things like tuition benefits or 10% 401k matches that can easily add 20% to your base salary vs competitors.

A number like ""$100k"" tells you very, very little without that context."
599,"That is how it should be. A person's first interest in a job is usually the salary. I hate that it's taboo to talk about- it's the main motivator yet we're expected to ~~her~~ be secretive about it. 

It's not greedy to be interested in the amount- it's sensible. It's literally a huge part of what defines your life and future.

 They're treating it like a car buying experience.

602,"A lot of companies don't think that way.

As a hiring manager, we want our employees to be happy and stick around at our company.  If we hire people for the bare minimum, we know they may not be happy.  Sure, they'll ""accept"" the pay, but next thing you know they are grumpy and looking on job boards.  We want them to be happy.  We want them to grow their careers and do what's best for them.  Yes we want to develop them and hope they stay, but at the same time, if an opportunity at another company helps them in their career, we even encourage them to pursue it (just give us time to find a replacement please!).  This type of culture is what enables us to hire the best people in the industry.  It's why EVERYONE wants to work for our company.  Word gets around and you reap what you sow.

I understand the reasons for jaded opinions, hate for corporate greed, etc. But reality does not always align with those emotionally based opinions.  We want to make a lot of money at our corporation.  And the way we do that is by investing in our people. We have the best, and you get what you pay for.  Wanting to make a shit ton of money is not a bad thing.  In fact, ""doing the right thing"" is usually a better way to make that money than by being cheapskate bastards.

All that being said, yes it is still a negotiation and we want to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both the employee and the company.  We aren't just throwing money around like a fool."

615,"GME SQUEEZE

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

•	⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. •	⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. •	⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

•	⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. •	⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

>During the financial crisis of 2008, failures to deliver increased. Much the same as check kiting, where someone writes a check but has not yet secured the funds to cover it, sellers did not surrender securities sold on time. They delayed the process to buy securities at a lower price for delivery. Regulators still need to address this practice. 

What I can assume is that there was a lot of naked call selling during this time and whoever sold the calls is struggling to buy the actual shares needed to fulfill the call options contract.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

Jim Cramer himself, [""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

Investopedia \[""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic \]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

648,"This is likely what is happening. A naked short has the temporary ability to *depress* prices due the the creation of ""fraudulent"" shares. The only way this benefits the fund is if they can turn sentiment along with the drop in prices and force the market to sell. That way they can obtain shares to cover the short. For the autists: [https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2008/2/v31n1-6.pdf](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2008/2/v31n1-6.pdf)

This is why i believe it intrinsically has more value. But the reality if there is a buyer that needs the stock. And you own it. You set the price anyways. It just increases their need to get the stock from you. Setting aside the corruption. Which really basically throws everything out the window. The only way this all fails is if there is MAJOR corruption. But definitely possible.

Not a financial expert. I'm dumb."
653,"The counterfeitingstock link from OP had more information about *how* they sell shares that they don't have, my concern is about their ability to manipulate the fail-to-delivers and kick the can down the road:

> SEC rules also allow the seller of a naked short to treat the purchase of a naked call as a borrowed share, thereby keeping their naked short off the SEC's fails–to–deliver list. A share of stock that has a naked call as its borrowed shares is marked as a disclosed short when it is sold, even though nobody in the transaction actually owns a share.

The sec.gov rules page is a mess of thousands of pages of pdfs that make it difficult to specifically find the rule about writing/buying these naked calls or which rule explicitly allows them to count as covering a short... but I have no doubt that the big players will be using every dirty trick in the book to lie about their actual positions and minimize their losses."
654,i'd be ok being part of a movement that causes a market correction if it leads to positive outcome like NOT ALLOWING A FUND TO TAKE 130% SHORT INTEREST
655,"I've read 1-2 papers on clearing so maybe I'm all wrong.  But here goes. tldr: if the seller does an FTD (failure to deliver), the buyer receives an FTR (a failure to receive). An FTR is a coupon that looks exactly like a share and sorta acts like one.

\---

D+0: Bob the Buyer buys 100 shares XYZ at $20 per share. Sam the Seller sells 100 shares XYZ at $20 per share. An exchange matches them up. They have a deal.

D+1: Bob's broker delivers $2000 cash to NSCC (a subsidiary of DTCC). Sam's broker delivers 100 shares XYZ to NSCC.

D+2: NSCC delivers 100 shares XYZ to Bob's broker. Bob's broker puts the shares in Bob's account. NSCC delivers $2000 cash to Sam's broker. Sam's broker puts the shares in Sam's account.

\---

Now, suppose Sam is a sneaky snake and does not deliver the shares. Maybe Sam is a short seller but failed to borrowed the shares. Maybe Sam is a naked short seller and never even tried. to borrow the shares

That's called Failure to Deliver (FTD). One of several things happens.

Alternative A: Sam's broker finds 100 shares XYX somehow and delivers them to NSCC and we're back on track. Sam's broker now has a beef with Sam.

Alternative B: Sam's broker does an FTD. NSCC finds the shares of XYZ somehow and delivers those shares to Bob's broker.  NSCC now has a beef with Sam's broker (and Sam's broker has a beef with Sam).

Altnerative C: Sam's broker does an FTD. NSCC doesn't find the shares. Get this! NSCC creates a coupon called a ""fail to receive"" and transfers that coupon to Bob's broker. Bob's broker puts the FTR coupon in Bob's account. The FTR coupon looks and acts a lot like 100 shares of XYZ. Bob doesn't even know his stock is just an ersatz FTR.

Bob can trade like XYZ, Bob can collect dividends (someone is on the hook for those dividends). However Bob cannot vote the FTR, and Bob cannot hypothecate the FTR for margin credit. Bob probably can't order a physical certificate either (if it's a stock that has physical certificate). 

In Alternative C, NSCC will work to quietly replace the FTR with real stock as time goes by.

\---

As I understand it, this system works okay when there's accidents, like when Bob's broker and Sam's broker report two different versions of what the trade actually does. Or when there's occasional FTD. But again, in my understanding, naked short sellers figured out that they can abuse the system by placing sell orders and then intentionally FTD.

\---

Whew. That's the retard version. Now what I want is someone from AOC's office, and someone else from Ted Cruz's office, who really actually knows this stuff, to drop by the SEC, pick up the full non-redacted versions of these records (with the names of sellers who FTD'd hundreds of thousands of GME shares), and then write some laws with some teeth so that sellers cut down on the so-called ""strategic FTD"". And as long as I'm fapping about this, I'll also fantasize that the media write some honest explainers about this stuff. Bloomberg and CNBC should have some analyst reporters who can do better than one broken down old fart on WSB."

However, the keep trying to fuck over my personal account.  Stupid shit like you said above.  

I kindly tell them that if they don't fix it I'm going to close my corporate account. They then look at the balance on my corporate account, how long we've been there, and how much we run through it every year, and then they suddenly start kissing my ass.

OH!  Sorry sorry sir!  We will fix this immediately!

I don't have time to close my WF accounts now but I'm done doing business with them. Any new business will be done through credit unions."
665,"This is pretty hyperbolic. While it is true the competitive landscape is changing in favor of a lower cost online platform, calling the branch model a MLM scheme is bit out of touch.

The old model of retail banking is dying and has been dying for some time. A bank doesn't need a branch on every corner to service its retail customers and an increasing amount of consumer transactions are being done via cashless processes (credit, debit, venmo, online transfers, e-checks, etc). As a result banks are evolving to compete in this new landscape -- if they don't, they will continue to carry high fixed costs while seeing customers flee to online focused banks that can offer better rates as a result of having a lower cost platform. Banks are increasingly closing brick & mortar branches as opposed to opening new ones, and laying off branch staff as volumes decline.

While my banking experience falls outside of the retail side of banking, I'd bet dollars to donuts the limits on which type of ""stranger"" accounts cash can be deposited into has to do with regulatory compliance and wanting to improve the paper trail of cash transfers and deposits to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, etc.

Credit unions are fine, but let's arrive at that conclusion with reasonable logic. "

3) the corruption is really bad. Not going to fight it. But there is a large caucus within the ANC trying to drive out the corruption. So depending on which faction wins, your puts could get wrecked. 

4) the Reserve Bank is independent (for now) so your QE fears are exaggerated. Inflation is largely driven by increasing import prices because the exchange rate has tanked. Why the exchange rate has tanked is complicated. Idk if it will continue to deteriorate. If you want to short SA, a currency short may not be good. 
During COVID the reserve Bank has been very reluctant to lower interest rates. They are arguably too conservative. Money printing is not a valid fear imo. If the reserve bank is nationalized, then you should worry. 

5) instead of a currency short look at shorting the small caps on the Joburg stock exchange.  Most of them are dog shit but still priced like they will succeed. 

6) investors should be shit scared of the Economic freedom fighters. However, they are unlikely to win an election any time in the future.

A PRIVATELY held corporation that are not obligated to reveal anything or their records, yet they are in charge of the trading of PUBLICALLY listed stocks?!


Just some exerpts from the wiki alone https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation


1) Total assets US$46,971,101,000 (2018)


2) Several companies sued DTCC, **without success**, over delivery failures in their stocks, alleging culpability for naked short selling.


3) Critics blamed DTCC, noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where the naked short selling happens, alleging that DTCC **turned a blind eye** to the problem, and complaining that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not taken sufficient action against naked shorting.


3) DTCC responded that it had no authority over trading activities, and **could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered**, and suggested that naked shorting was simply **not widespread enough to be a major concern.**


4) In July 2007, Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah, suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling were ""serious enough"" to warrant a hearing. The Senate Banking Committee's Chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd, indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing. **No such hearing was ever held, however.**


5) Representing state stock regulators, the NASAA filed a brief in a 2009 suit against DTCC, arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit. NASAA said that ""if the Investors' claims are taken as true, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of **fraud and manipulation** at the hands of the very entities that **should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market**"". **The suit was dismissed.** Critics also contended that **DTCC and the SEC were too secretive** with information about where naked shorting was taking place.


Out of all these #3 has to be the worst. **could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered**. Can't enforce **FAILURES TO DELIVER**?!?! Then wtf? I can just keep writing IOUs forever knowing nobody can claim them?!! HOW IS THIS SHIT POSSIBLE!"
690,"What IF the (majority) of hedge funds covered Mon-Wed last week when the volumes were over 180M every day. This is what Melvin told the Sec and has reported this loss. Then the volumes drop massively from Thur onwards. Then new HFs come in and short at 200-300.
They are printing money at any price below 200. 
They obviously still need to cover but there is no pressure on them. They can buy small amounts each day. Yesterday morning when the volume was over 10M might have been HF buying some to avoid the borrow fees over the weekend.

I don’t know if this is true but it’s a real possibility and the price over the last week reflects this.

A short squeeze is still possible but only if the price goes above 200. 
It’s is not what people want to hear but they should consider it before they buy more."
691,"A few guesses:

1. Trends show that retail is not relenting ever, and therefore shorters are paying interest waiting for something that will never happen.
2. Another bet of the shorters takes a crap and they get margin called and have to start closing their positions.
3. The short writer of the stock requests it back. This could happen for numerous reasons, one being tax reasons related to receiving stock dividends.
4. The Gamestop board does a reverse stock split, which requires everyone to return their stock to be issued one new stock for every two stock.
5. En mass purchasing of the stock driving it up quickly (like what was happening last week, but also combined with #6....)
6. Increases in stock combined with a series of calls becoming in the money like dominoes (call for $80 is ITM, MM buys stock to cover, that raises price to $90, call for $90 is ITM, MM buys stock to cover etc....)."

713,"""4. Stop orders may reduce, but not eliminate, your trading risk.
A stop market order is an order, placed with your broker, to buy or sell a particular stock at
the market price if and when the price reaches a specified level. Stop orders are often
used by traders in an effort to limit the amount they might lose. If and when the market
reaches whatever price you specify, a stop order becomes an order to execute the desired
trade at the best price immediately obtainable.
There can be no guarantee, however, that it will be possible under all market conditions to
execute the order at the price specified. In an active, volatile market, the market price may
be declining (or rising) so rapidly that there is no opportunity to liquidate your position at
the stop price you have designated. Under these circumstances, the broker's only
obligation is to execute your order at the best price that is available. Therefore, stop
orders may reduce, but not eliminate, your trading risk."""

In keeping with a comment which is three hundred and seventeen words long: I too, am keeping my response to a meagre three hundred and seventeen words. I feel that more words would seem to be trying to overshadow the importance and value of this comment by user, u/unmicsiunmujdei, which is surely one of their most important, most valuable, and most honest. Furthermore it seems clear, to me, that for me to post a comment which was *less* than the three hundred and seventeen words utilized by this user u/unmicsiunmujdei would be to ignore justice, and fail to serve this comment with its own due.

Ironically, robinhood has been stealing from us and giving to the rich. We've been stuck with crummy stimulus checks while big money gets all the bailouts and billions, when the fact of the matter is that we are busting our asses just trying to survive.

We are in an unprecedented movement that is actively fucking these turds in the ass, and they're crying themselves to sleep just like we have for years. This is about more than greed and personal gain, this is about equality for all and punishment for the ones taking advantage of us. Our movement transcends the singular person, we are a force that cannot be stopped. I've never been prouder of us retards.

I think this will hurt their brand in the near/mid-term, but some of the most successful companies have survived severe public backlash. People also tend to have short term memory. A year from now, nobody may be talking about this unless more market craziness happen. With that said, I hate them and what they actually stand for.

750,"We were annoyed with that dynamic and spitballing about trying to codify it as a rule, not one that we would break our backs enforcing in every comment, but something you can yell at people when they stay away from the right way to do things. The way I was gonna phrase it was:

---

**Trading is Not a Team Sport**

If you're tempted to be part of a troupe and say things like ""we need to focus on..."", or ""they're shills for not focusing on..."" then you're in the wrong spot. We're here to make money for number one (with friends) and you should be too. Stocks are not sports teams.

---

We can enforce stuff like that to varying levels of strictness depending on how much sanity we have to burn but the best thing is for you to convince the people around you to snap out of the ""we"" stuff.

I've seen it manifest in a lot of different ways, from being mad that WSB isn't ""focusing"" on their stock, to calling everyone talking about other stocks ""hedgie shills"", to creating communities where you can't even try to poke holes in their thesis or be tossed out by bots, to assuming that because a spam post got deleted or a good post got spammed that we're on the opposite team.

At the end of the day, it's mostly on you guys to teach the newer people how to do things. We can block phrases and spend all day spamming stuff, but that only works as far as the situation stays the same and motivation is constantly high, which it never does/is.

BTW we're considering making an oldfags thread that'll have a grandfathered period of pre-gme and some kind of rolling criteria for good posters to show people what WSB can look like. A little smoky back office. We were thinking about making any user be able to reply, but only top level comments be older users. Interested? Thoughts on that last bit?

Ever since GME it's been a good bet. A few hedgefunds up their holdings of ""wallstreetbet darlings,"" the price moves, a few male ""bossbabes"" start spamming wsb with tickers like their very own MLM campaign, the hedge funds up it even more and then FOMO sets in and then its time to cash out

As far as I can tell the only time it hasn't worked is GME because they sold to soon. 

It's big benefit is that I don't think there's been one good non-Citadel ticker. If they don't have shares, and it's on wsb, it's not pumping. In that sense it's probably saved me more money than it's made me when I think about fomo'ing

Also hedgefunds have a lot of capital to send out there. Not everyone can YOLO into CLOV back on May 5 when we learned about this and watch their money bleed out until the right amount of bossbabes and hedgefunds get the pump ready... but if you can throw a few bucks into it, it's not bad

771,"To be honest I've been saying stuff like this for years and it felt like no one listened.

I remember leaving school with no prospects. Picking up work where I could. Being angry at the system because big money got bailed out while I fell in with the 'wrong' crowd (absolute bros who know what a hard life is like tbh but thats another story) got kinda deep into drugs (and shoplifting to pay for it)

At some point I got sick of it and scored myself a job in sales. It sucked the Life out of me but I was pretty good at it. So my shitty sales job got me a slightly better sales job and keeping my head down got me a really good sales job at a really big company. I was there for about 8 months before I realised I couldnt do it anymore.

But through this experience I became a supporter of capitalism. That individual people have the power to put themselves in a better position more than any charity or group or government could so I gave up my nice cosy salary and indebted myself to start a degree (I should graduate in a few months with a degree in compsci) 

I'm still not in a great position financially in fact I'm broke as shit and wish i had some skin in this game. But I've learned and grown and gained some valuable new skills i can hopefully go and make a decent living from with enough to go and make these types of bets and take an ownership stake in the companies that make our economy tick over. 

I'm so proud of you guys cause you're giving me hope that I was right, that we can take things over and start running things ourselves and that maybe... just maybe... with all these tendies you shitheads make you might actually start to stimulate some real sustainable growth both by taking some for yourselves and splashing some cash, by taking improved stakes in other companies and by creating new seed capital for start ups.

A bit of a rant:
Despite what many naysayers say quantum computing has exceeded all expectations in the last 2 years. The people gambling on it have proven correct. We can coherently manipulate large ensembles of qubits, “quantum bits.” Still, there is a lot of hype that threatens progress.

774,"See my other comment. You won’t have the opportunity to invest in quantum computing for at least a year or two. All the major companies are either focusing on growth or have been absorbed by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. It’s a real shame, too, because the companies that have acquired startups are focused on 1-5 year gains. Pressure, in this case leads to poor products or hype. The reality is that quantum computing is the most complicated engineering challenge man has ever faced. You think going from 20nm to 5 nm was tough, quantum computing is much harder but has the potential for gains that will rival what we have seen from the time of Turing to now.

A ~52 logical qubit chip owned by Google achieved quantum supremacy (just Google “quantum supremacy Google”). We are aiming for 100-10000+ logical qubits in the near future. The computational capabilities of such systems will revolutionize drug design, materials and optimal portfolios 🙄."

Our execution led to a profitable fourth quarter that included a 6.5% comparable store sales growth, a 175% increase in global E-Commerce sales and a $92.6 million reduction in SG&A. The past year also saw us take steps to accelerate our de-densification efforts and streamline our store footprint, leverage our retail locations to provide same-day delivery and curbside pickups, and continue to enhance our suite of E-Commerce platforms. We also added important experience to our board by appointing several new directors with backgrounds in corporate finance, E-Commerce and technology and subsequently established a strategy-focused committee to accelerate our transformation.”

“We are off to a strong start in 2021 as February comparable store sales increased 23%, led by continued strength in global hardware sales. As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities that are in front of us as we begin prioritizing long-term digital and E-Commerce initiatives while continuing to execute on our core business during this emerging console cycle. Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue,” Sherman concluded.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

Investopedia \[""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic \]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

815,"""The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.
By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.""

817,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals.
They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.
Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.
Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...
Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.
Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).
When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.
This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?
Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.
Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:
Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.
An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.
If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

819,"Yeah, we tried it... the CFO laid off an entire division at Apple.

I guess it all depends on the size of the company. In huge Apple/Google/Amazon companies... I'm afraid explotation of low wage earnings is part of the game.

There is just so much demand from employes, they're desperate to put the A or the G on their resumes, and they take bad deals. As soon as they're ready to get the good deal, they get cut and replaced with a bunch of morons.

I've even seen multiple aquire-hires geniuses being forced out of the company under the weight of such beurocracy.

820,"SWE here making 78k just outside NYC. Been working at company for 5+ years. Started in QE and moved to SWE position after 1.5 years. Got a few big bumps up to where I am now, but this year only got 3.5%. A new manager took over my group and claimed because he was new he didn't want to make any waves by asking for a special increase (requires a good case).

Last month my director and manager called me into managers office to hand out bonus. My director (who took over my group from another director a few months ago) started saying how even though we've only bee working together a little while he really appreciates all I do. That's when I came out and said ""I don't make enough"". He asked me how much I make, and when I said the number he had a flaborgasted look on his face. He then proceeded to ask me if I was looking for a new job. I said not yet.

He claims he will be setting a meeting this month about getting me bumped up, but I'm not holding my breath... "
821,"This is true. I am literally living it. I was approached by another company asking if I would like a job, they gave me an offer. I asked if my current job would match it or go higher. They matched. 

The offering employer then counter offered. A few dollars more.. My current job did not want to match the counter. I start my new job in two weeks. 

Know your worth people! "
822,"A few years ago my work cut everyone’s pay. When I hit my 3rd year I asked for a raise. My boss gave it to me, the same amount that they cut almost a year earlier. About a month later everyone got their pay cuts back, but it was on the DL. My “raise” was me getting my pay cut back, just like everyone else. Except they didn’t tell me I was getting it back either way. Mother fuckers, because I don’t talk about pay with my coworkers I didn’t realize this"
823,"Seems oversimplified. I'd agree that replacing an employee has a cost and one should not be shy to use it as a leverage. But few anecdotes from my personal experience:

* Years ago I worked as an intern in a company. We had to deal with warehouse workers. Most of the workers there would leave within 6 months. I asked our financial director, why they did not want to put any effort to retain them, seemed like a waste of resources. But he clearly explained, that even though some training was required, it was still cheaper to replace regularly than retain. First, it was an entry-level position, young folks without experience flocked there. They always had a pool to select few sane candidates. Training would take up to two week, which was called a probation and they were paid peanuts. They salary was low anyhow. They could have fucked up, but it was mitigated by having few permanent supervisors with dictatorial management style, so damage was controlled and predictable. Trying to retain them would require someone's dedicated attention and more money. It did not make sense, because everything worked as expected and it was not a dream job anyway. Good worker would leave soon enough regardless, bad workers weren't worth retaining. **Sometimes high employee attrition rate is a feature, not a bug.**

* My uncle is an accountant. He has been with the same company for a long time. Their accounting is intensive. He manages a team of 5-7. He always complains that it is very hard to find adequate people. He is not even expecting smart or experienced candidates, just sane and trainable. He has to let someone go often. I suggested that he needs to set up a more rigorous interview process. He laughed. Their pay is low, not enough to attract high quality candidates or retain them for a long time. His boss is very stingy and my uncle has to battle him for every penny. He isn't paid great, but enough to stay put and deal with it. Over the years he was able to get a somewhat satisfactory salary for few of his subordinates he likes and if a bonus comes his way, he usually splits it with the rest to keep them motivated. I met few of his ex-coworkers at his birthday party, as far as I could see there was a good understanding of the work affairs between them. He mostly tries to motivate them by being a good boss, providing training, allowing flexible hours or extra leave when possible and making them feel very comfortable. But when one of his aforementioned coworkers received a better offer, my uncle was like: ""I am glad for you, take it because we won't be able to match it"". **At the end of the day, you and your manager are in the same boat and they are limited in what they can do for you.**

* I have been with my current company for almost 7 years. Company designs medical equipment, R&D. Lots of bright, talented, educated and ambitious folks with various backgrounds. The company has few thousand employees over multiple locations. People leave all the time, our department is the one that actually delivers products. When I joined I saw few lead researchers leaving, it surely seemed like a big deal. At one time I thought the world was going to end (in other words we would't be ready to demo a product at an upcoming conference), but no, everything was fine. Some people left, new people got hired and onboarded, someone got promoted, responsibilities redistributed. His project got delayed, but projects get delayed all the time and for various reasons, someone's departure can be a drop in the bucket. Later another senior researcher left that I was sort of close with. He asked for more money, his salary at that time was ~130k, he asked for 20k more, but would have settled for 10-15k. Just the payment to an external recruiter for someone with his expertise would be 20% of his annual salary, so 20k+, this excludes time and effort required from the company to interview and onboard a person. But his project was not important enough for the company, in fact after he left they did not hire his replacement for a long time, other things were a priority. So it was either switching to another project or switching to another company, he chose the latter: smaller company, strictly focused on his area of expertise, he got much more significant pay raise. **He was sort of overqualified for his position. Leaving was a win - win for everyone.**

* Another example, one of our engineers left. He was not a PhD or anything, nevertheless it was a well established fact that he knew his shit. Asked for a raise multiple times, I don't know the numbers. He did not get it, found a better offer within weeks and left, they had to replace him fast and it wasn't easy. His relationship with his manager was not great, it was alright, but they had few pain points, mostly personal: different temper, different personalities. Not too bad overall, but not good enough for his manager to try harder to match the salary. In the bigger picture most likely for a company it'd make sense to retain him, **but personal relationships inevitably come into play and need to be considered.**

* A friend of mine was working for a government contractor. Then he got an offer from Tesla to join as a battery engineer. Hot job, hot company, good compensation, he had to move though, which meant higher cost of living, but seemed worthy. He left within 9 month and last few months he was dragging it. Simply bad work life balance, expectations of working overtime, encouraged by the company culture. He wanted to spend time with his family and on his hobbies. **Often, for a higher pay you need to sacrifice more**

* My sister-in-law is a nurse supervisor in cardiology. She was underpaid for a long time and as soon an opening became available, she switched, much happier now, same job, worse commute, more money. But the field is very specific and there are only so many hospitals around and only so many rn supervisors are needed at any given time in the area. **Average pay can be higher, but little hiring going on.**

* Switching jobs cost employees as well as employers. Stress can be significant. Looking for a job, applying, interviewing, negotiating, waiting. At the same time if you are an adult you have life that does not stop, errands piling up, your current job is demanding. So far every skilled professional 30+ I've met already has a health condition, that needs to be taken care of. Even those with a healthy lifestyle, it's either some joint injuries, back pain, migraines, headaches, etc. you name it. **Life is demanding and every bit of stress counts. New job is a new stress.**

* Last example: we had 2 new hires, recent grads from top schools. They are definitely sharp, but they started shopping around and asking for more money merely 6 months in, both left, no one tried to stop them. They weren't wrong that they could get more, and they most likely did. But I was disappointed to get them up to speed only to find out that they were already looking for a better place. Even though they were smart and promising, there are people who always actively looking, such behavior detract from they value. Always thinking about pay raise or another job takes the focus away. **So when there is time to negotiate your salary, don't be shy, but then you need to hit certain milestones, to do it again.**

*Edit: grammar.*

"
824,"Known as a ""salary dump.""  In a lot of organizations they have performance metrics.  A person is given a guaranteed raise and a bonus based on performance.  as time goes on their performance goes down but it would be improper to give them a demotion and they would not stick around without a bonus.  In this case starting fresh saves you a lot of money."
825,"Strictly speaking, it's often  better salary-wise but I don't think it's always better.

Salary and raises are only taboo because you think they are. I have found that being really direct and honest helps tremendously.

For example, give your boss a heads-up by saying ""Hey I'd like a chance to discuss my salary soon - maybe sometime next week/month?"" which gives them time to prepare a bit. Maybe you've been agonizing over your ""get a raise"" game plan for months, but your boss may be oblivious. Dropping a bomb on them like another job offer might seem like it's coming out of the blue.

When it is time to talk, don't jump straight to trying to get a raise. Simply ask about their expectations to qualify for a raise. I'm talking of course about a significant raise and/or promotion, not a standard yearly review kind of thing. Try to nail down specifics - things you can point to in the near future once they've been accomplished.

A big part of the problem is that people want their raise ASAP, but the best time to plan for a raise is always 6 months ago. Every significant pay bump I've received happened around 3-9 months AFTER I started gunning for it. The best time to talk about a raise is a few months into your new job. That way you can clearly communicate that you are not asking for a raise - you are planning for one.

Getting a raise isn't honestly about market rate research, competing offers, and financial arithmetic. It is about communication, expectations, planning, performing, and keeping a good attitude."
826,">  every team wants players with high VORP, and will go out of their way to retain them, within reason. 

Assuming the team wants to be competitive. Maybe they aren't a really wealthy operation, so maybe you're playing for the Oakland A's. But there's also teams that don't care about keeping their best players because the owner can make money even if the team sucks every year. See the clippers and Donald Sterling for an example."
827,"I've personally experienced that. The company directly suffered as former employees told me production in my area of expertise dropped off significantly as they tried to find a replacement. This created severe operational drag, and other more seasoned employees were pulled away from their primary work to fill the gaps. A good chunk of them sought and found other work. Not sure what happened to that company as I couldn't care less because the boss truly sucked, but it was nice hearing from former employees that the firing set off a series of events, which compounded the issues. 

Let folks be irrational at their own expense, honestly. We could do without a lot of these companies who are run poorly and try to make their employees suffer for their own administrative failures. And the first step to destroying destructive businesses and practices is to educate folks like this subreddit does so well. Employees have the power, but are tricked into believing they don't. We need to stick it to assholes more often, rather than get duped into electing them."
828,"A lot of them use cloud-based HCM platforms, but plenty don't. I would imagine major companies likely have implemented cloud-based HCM platforms by now, though. It's a no-brainer in regards to cost savings. What's crazy is how Kronos has so many partner companies that essentially sell their product under different ""brands"". Smart business model, I guess."
829,A company that doesn't at least give you a cost of living increase annually is actually cutting your pay every year. 
830,"I'm in a situation like this right now.
A colleague is leaving us for a competitor and told me in confidence what he was offered in terms of pay and its >35% higher than what I'm making now.
He's even admitted that I know more than he does, which could easily get me another 5-10% on top of the 35%.

To make matters worse, my current salary (that's 35% less than what I could be getting) was **just** negotiated in December. And it wasn't even easy getting the amount that I'm at now. They pushed back pretty hard. Which is surprising given the fact that my boss has literally said ""I honestly don't know what I'd do if you left."" 

I'm starting to feel like leaving is the only way I'll get what I'm worth. "
831,Which is another large scale issue is everyone is focused on shareholder returns and not having a strong happy team ans great products. A 5% raise  couls motivate and employee to do tremendous work for the company but that is not easily documented.
832,"I need to stop doing my job so well. Literally. As my company has seen how I've handled more and more responsibility and still produced excellent work, they just shovel more my way. A co-worker left and I absorbed %90 of his client responsibility with no additional compensation (yet). I'm going to ask for a (negotiable) %20 raise because all the clients I work with love me and I have some of the biggest accounts. But I'm already looking for better opportunities and if I find something I really like I'd rather take that."
833,"I've been a math teacher for 10 years in a struggling district. After a few years, it becomes seriously deflating to see unmotivated/incompetent coworkers prosper along side you, often making significantly more for barely getting out of their seat. And it's not just jealousy. Try managing a classroom of kids who are allowed to run amuck for 75% of the day. Now try getting the majority of them to work and care about math after your colleagues have ingrained low expectations and let them come and go while getting an A for coloring in the lines.

EDIT: In case it's not clear...my school is unionized. It's been nice to have the increased confidence going into a meeting knowing you won't be outright fired or laid off to save cash on poorly planned budget expenses. However, I can't fathom anyone actually believing there is no downside. From my perspective, it's darn close to 50% pro/con...and I've taught in both unionized and non-unionized school districts."
834,I'd say there are a lot of jobs that a 15 year person isn't doing it much better than someone who's been there for 4 or 5 years. A lot of jobs just aren't that complex and it doesn't matter.
835,">every 2-3 years

It is now 1-2 years. Companies are having trouble keeping their own workforce. Silicon Valley is notorious for high turn over rates in the long term. Most companies lose 20% of their workforce in a year. Within five year you have no senior staff who has been there for more than 2-3 years. This means your company can't have a long term goal because you're constantly trying to keep staff and the lights on. So cost cutting employees salaries is an easy way to do this. A lot of corporate executives know this problem and a lot of them inherited this mess from their predecessors. The 2020s will be a bloodbath for corporations professional staff. A lot of boomers are expected to retire by 2021. This will leave a massive shortage in a lot of jobs. Millennial college graduates won't be able to replace them. Bill Gates talks a lot about the impending college graduate shortage. "
836,"> I'm starting to feel like leaving is the only way I'll get what I'm worth. 

Welcome to the world we live in.  I've left jobs because they refused to pay me what I feel I'm worth, and a competitor was willing to pay.

> my boss has literally said ""I honestly don't know what I'd do if you left.""

That's his problem, and no one elses.  Pay me or I'm out of here.  A 30% payrise is too large to ignore IMO."
837,I work with a team of 6 equivalents in a unionized position.  A fight about job descriptions and pay scale broke out and we want an extra 5k/year because we're doing way more than our job description says we do.   Management is fighting it tooth and nail.  I know that myself and two others both have interviews elsewhere this month.  The 3 of us combined closed 80% of the issues last year.   Yeah it's an extra 30k/year but realistically the pain that will come should all 3 of us leave  will be brutal.   
838,"There are 2 schools of thought:

1. Older employees are fixed in their ways and won't change

2. Older employees know the tips and tricks, and have been burned by mistakes (which they'll never make again).

I think it comes out to a job-to-job basis. A job that requires people to do and redo the same task multiple times probably can get better performance from a newer, hungrier guy. Whereas, a more complicated job, where everyday is  a new challenge, would benefit a lot from experience!"
839,"Speaking from experience as a younger guy: that hunger fades if nothing good comes of it. A guy I worked with just quit after my employer seemed to (I haven't confirmed this) treat a promotion into my position as a side step at the same time that I got promoted right after an unrelated pay increase. Now I'm covering two positions and it's a matter of time until one in particular falls behind.

I'm working 50hr weeks to manage it but my patience is going to fade fast if I don't get a pay bump when I think the time is right to ask for one.

If I leave there would be no one dedicated to working an entire department and there's a good 6 months before you can 100% fly solo and the first month someone has to show you the basics. The position I moved to was supposed to relieve our guy that floats between a few different things and it's helped tremendously and I cought on to my new spot fairly quickly."
840,"Depends on what kind of business you're managing.  A grocery store?  Yeah, any idiot can wave groceries over a scanner, put them in a bag, and inform customers that, no, they can't help because they have no idea where anything is located in the store.  A factory with a bunch of specialized machinery?  You'd damn well better hang onto the folks with 10 years experience because they are the only ones who are familiar with every little quirk and trick of the machinery.  Let them go and your new guys will be struggling to produce parts half as fast as what the experienced guys could do."
841,A cashier is a great example of this -- I totally agree.  There really aren't any rules that satisfy all of the various conditions we find in the workplace.
842,">  A lot of accountants (also shareholders) only see numbers and how they can reduce them. Unfortunately those are the types of people that managers have to answer to when companies go through all sorts of cost cutting and hiring freezes.

I've never worked in a corporation where accountants were responsible for budgets.  Not ever.

They balance the books and their numbers inform strategy and spending -- but the decisions are made by C-suite execs.

The worst I've had is similar to what you're describing, though.  I've been told that we need to cut headcount, for instance, but never *who* I had to cut."
843,"6 months after I started my job, I said I wouldn't be there longer than 5 years if I wasn't getting compensated fairly. The only reason it's longer than the general 2-3 year suggestion I see a lot is because a) I spent the better part of a decade being a stay at home mom, so I need time to pad my resume and b) I don't have a degree so again, resume padding. 

So far, I'm doing well with that. A year and a half in and I'm doing awesome at gaining skills that I otherwise wouldn't have. "
844,"What if the new college grad had a higher degree? What if the educational model had changed to something more efficient then when you were trained? 

There are fields where the work environment is changing. In those fields, people who have 10+ years experience are far more likely to resist change. 

You should be paid based off of both experience and future expected value. A 25 year old is more likely going to out produce a 50 year old over the next 10 years. 

Even more so for Tech fields. If you’ve been around since before computers were common then you’re already at a huge disadvantage. The younger generations are ingrained from the get go. "
845,Which company do you work for? I've heard TV/Film these days is mostly run by middle age professionals who were headhunted from other industries. Plus Hollywood is being flooded with Chinese professionals as well. A lot of companies are afraid of losing young people. They can't hire anyone else. The market doesn't have that many people in the college graduate level. A lot of people attended college but never graduated. This is why Bill Gates keeps telling millennial that their time will come. A lot of boomers didn't expect to live to their 60 and 70s. 
846,">  There are fields where the work environment is changing. In those fields, people who have 10+ years experience are far more likely to resist change.

I work in software development - the very definition of a constantly evolving discipline.  Most of my peers have 10+ years of experience.  None would still be employed if they resisted change.

>  You should be paid based off of both experience and future expected value. A 25 year old is more likely going to out produce a 50 year old over the next 10 years.

Never going to happen, nor should it.  What happens when the person you're paying like a senior X decides to leave just as he gains those skills?

You should get paid what your work is worth *now* "
847,"Thats a really ugly assumption. A lot of jobs plateau. The skills needed to perform the job plateau. The responsibilities plateau. The pay plateaus.

Take my prior career into consideration - it wasnt results oriented. It was a technician job that paid well(but little raises) and in this job there are many ways to skin a cat. My job wasnt to pump out support tickets as fast as I can, it was to provide customer service and resolve the issue. This was an IT field, but the same goes for mechanics, plumbers, contractors, electricians, etc.

At the end of the day, its not about ""using those 15 years particularly well"" these jobs are about ""did you resolve the issue and is the customer happy, yes or no?"" A lot of times, your job CAN be done by someone younger and newer. The difference is, you have been there 15 years and you know your customers and they know you. Youve seen every issue in the book and you know how to fix it. Sure, the young guy will eventually fix it and while you know you fixed it faster, management just sees that it still got resolved. You also know what your bosses expect and how to keep business processes rolling. 

But at the end of the day, a lot of businesses dont give a shit about that. They dont care that youre a great loyal employee who you really should be keeping, they care about saving an extra $10/hr to put into their own pockets.

So again I say, your assumption is really insulting to people who did their job well, excelled at it, poured their heart into it and still got fired for the younger guy all in the name of higher profits for those at the top who are literally riding off of the work that you do.

849,"A worker who hustles is legitimately a better worker for the company though.  If I have to choose as a manager the guy that hustles and a guy who does his time and their at the same salary both pushing for a raise it's going to the hustler.

When your young it's honestly the best time to be that way though as you need to get established in your field and the faster you can boost your salary the better.  Once your established though then yeah don't fall for that corporate line anymore"
850,"Well maybe. A worker that hustles and works unpaid overtime isn’t necessarily doing more work, or better work. Often times, it’s just that people equate amount of time worker with the quality of work, and worker ethic. There are plenty of studies that show diminishing returns when more hours are worked. Especially within knowledge work. But the perception that people are doing more is coloring the view of that employee. Lots of exceptions, lots of caveats and it sometimes does work in the short term (a couple weeks), but it usually means the employee working longer hours is not adding that much, if anything."
851,"I'd say nonprofit is difficult in this regard because there's an expectation that you're supposed to be doing it for the love of the work.  A lot of people *are* doing it for the love of the work, of course, but it makes it easier to guilt your employees (your raise would take money from the mission, after all) or otherwise take advantage of them (the hours expected for the pay is usually not great). 

Turnover has been brutal in every nonprofit office I've worked in and it sucks because community relationships are obviously really important. "

Either right before or right after he hit 100B he cut himself down below 30B, gave practically everything but his Microsoft stake away to charity.

Having just blown a three run lead just four outs away from their elusive victory, the writing was on the wall. The cubs players were visibly demoralized, knowing that it was just a matter of time at this point. 

But then something happened that wasn’t supposed to. A freak cloudburst led to a 17 minute rain delay, and when play resumed they were a different team. Reinvigorated by this divine intervention, the cubs would score two runs in the top of the 10th to win their first championship in 108 years.

864,"So if I understand this correctly you now have two options if you want matching contributions from your employer - A) your contribution B) your student loan payment.

The skeptic in me says employers will just use this as an excuse to cut wages and benefits due to added cost. The folks affected are those who must choose between paying their student loans or funding their retirement. Since the only way out of a student loan is to pay or die, I foresee many new people claiming the employer match. I don't see how it's neutral for the employer.

To clarify, it's only neutral if employees switch from A to B. My gut says this plan will reel in many non-participants."
865,"A better, and long overdue, idea would be to let borrowers be able to discharge the student loan debt through bankruptcy, just like people can with medical bills, credit card debt, etc. "
866,"Finally, the voice of reason. So many comments from people praising this idea who are too caught up with the immediate benefit to them that they didn't think things all the way through and consider how badly this could fuck up the system even more than it is. 

A major problem with most people getting their health insurance through employer benefits is that you are tied to your job in order to continue receiving this crucial service. Do we really want to be adding on features that make you even more dependent on your job?"
867,"Well according to the article, and just common sense, paying off your debt as soon as possible *is* helping you save for retirement. The part that should resonate is this:

> A recent study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found that, while student debt does not discourage 401(k) participation, college graduates with student debt accumulate 50% less retirement wealth in their 401(k) by age 30 than those without. This new option should increase 401(k) balances for this group.


As a graduate drowning in student debt, I would see this as accurate. Considering I'm 24 now, I don't see myself fully paid off by the time I'm 30 at my current job path. I'll be close but not all the way there. 


With an option like this, I can pay off my loans sooner and explore more savings options for retirement rather than dumping all that I earn into a loan for a degree I earned years ago. Because right now I dont feel very incentivized to save as my college debt seems like a priority"
868,A 401(k) is a type of US retirement savings account offered by companies to their employees. It gives you tax advantages to save for your own retirement.
869,"But if you don't contribute to your 401k you don't get the matching funds.

A person paying their loans and not putting money into the 401k would qualify for a match under the new plan where today they don't."
870,"A lot of people struggling with student loans can't afford to contribute to their 401k's.  There are some people with a $1,000-$1,500 monthly loan payment that eats up all their free income. They are struggling just to get by and can't afford to put money into a 401k too. Now these people will still be able to get the matching funds at least.

I think these are the people who will really benefit from this, not the people with the luxury to choose 401k or loans. "
871,"> If you can refinance with better terms, go for it. But the reason why it's cheaper is because they can pick and choose which borrowers can refinance through them.

This is how SoFi started and was how they gained popularity.  But they have since expanded as they gained more investors.  

They no longer limit it to high earning graduates from quality schools.  The pool of applicants they try to refinance is much larger and they are selling extended repayment terms to lower monthly payments for people with interest rates that are no better. 

A lot of people are paying more money.

[Video of the Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpMEFtPZJLc)

""What's important when you're in that hedge fund mode, is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new view, to create a fiction.""

""Then you call the (Wall Street) Journal and get the bozo reporter in Research in Motion and you would feed that (rival) Palm's got a killer it's going to give away. These are all the things you must do on a day like today, and if you're not doing it, maybe you shouldn't be in the game.""

“It might cost me $15 million or $20 million to knock RIM down but it would be fabulous because it would beleaguer all the moron longs who are also keying on Research in Motion.""

""A lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund ... meaning I needed (a stock) down, I would create a level of activity beforehand that could drive the futures. It’s a fun game and it’s a lucrative game.""

""Who cares about the fundamentals? The great thing about the market is that it has nothing to do with the actual stocks.""

873,"Matt Levine write about this in his latest blog:

Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90—there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”

874,"As a result of this information.. Can't the market crash?

Would it be possible for the SEC to backtrack the naked shorts and remove them from the system? Obviously, causing jail time for the orchestrators but also crashing the market?

Alternatively, could they remove all naked shorts from their holders and then force Gamestop to actualize the shares thereby dropping the value of all GME shares by the percentage of created shares?

It also sounds like a third option of freezing the market is possible.. which would have catastrophic results all around.

Thx Matt Levine ‘Moneystuff’ if any of you wanna learn"
876,"Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, misinform, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't, and there are likely attempts to hype up other stocks that don't realistically have anywhere close to the same potential. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done because we are holding GME.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative to cover up things going much deeper. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens (or hundreds?) of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions and the data is extremely difficult to access, which is why we're in this situation. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Some places (like iborrowdesk) are no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. Setting your shares with limits means there are less shares to short, which increases the fees that those shorts have to pay. This helps with the squeeze. The selfless act is to avoid low limits (at least at first), but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it. Otherwise institutions holding might sell at higher rates than you do, which defeats the point.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts to hurt their bottom line. However, during transfer you'll be unable to trade, so you have to decide if that's worth it to you in this moment. Some have suggested doing partial transfers. Consider moving to SoFi. Like all brokers, it's tied into the system, but Chamath is entering the game and is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and probably offering the best option.

8. There's a lot of talk about Robinhood going insolvent. I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but the market value of GME even now is miniscule compared to everything else they cover. So I don't follow the logic how they're supposedly in financial trouble. If it DID go insolvent (not saying it will), people might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k. The medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to avoid much bigger losses. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. Be prepared to join a class action lawsuit if you owned any GME, AMC, etc, but let some more information feed in first. We're uncovering more of this each day. A lot of focus has been Robinhood, but it goes deeper as well. Robinhood and other institutions' actions were blatant market manipulation. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, consider joining as a Named Class Representative for financial returns specific to your case (rather than just what everyone gets). These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud.

10. Be cautious about buying at times when institutions can anticipate it and control how they handle your buy orders, such as market open. It's a major gamble if you're not setting limits. Consider letting the stock dip before you buy because we can expect a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's better to us all if you get more stocks, but the institutions are notoriously hard to beat at this game. They are, generally speaking, much better at this, and they cheat to imbalance everything.

11. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over or how deep this goes. There's new information suggesting there might be a lot of counterfeit stocks, which has historical precedent with Fannie Mae. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) for the full report. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand investigations and REAL consequences for these criminal behaviors. This matters.

12. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some technically legal, some illegal but easily concealed) attack vectors they use against us: flow orders, hidden data, AI algorithms, etc. They always win because the game is rigged. Shorting should be illegal. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement. Demand these things be changed.

13. For everyone saying hold until zero, that is a potentially dangerous sentiment. Holding may very well expose a lot of corruption, but those in financial need should not be risking their life savings. The goal is to distribute wealth to the PEOPLE, which means some of you should have an exit strategy or the institutions just win 100% of it.

14. Absolutely ESSENTIAL reading: [What is Counterfeit Stock](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html), [if the institutions counterfeited GME stock, it explains Wallstreet's terror](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/).

894,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

In order for shorts to have covered their positions, over 90% of the transactions would've needed to be shorts buying shares.

Clearly based on the stable price throughout the day, there has been a pretty even equilibrium between buying and selling.

This lower volume on a day that the stock is up over 100%, combined with the relatively stable daily chart says two things:

1. The shorts have not really started trying to cover.

2. A huge percentage of total shares are likely being held no matter what, or diamond handsed.

I do agree that this shouldn’t be your main place of learning but there are many fantastic traders on here and the breadth of information is valuable. 

Losing what you cant afford to lose is one of the worst feelings in the world. Its like finding out your wifes boyfriend is pimping her out behind Wendy’s to all your friends. 

Losing really makes you actually think about stuff. So put the effort in before hand, instead of retracing your steps after losing your shirt, do some real dd.

934,"Finally! A popular news source has stated what my circle has know for a long time. I'm a software developer in Jacksonville, FL with 4 years of professional experience and went from earning $30k to $87k in those 4 years by keeping my options open. I've transitioned from 4 different jobs in that time (6months, 6months, 2years, 1year so far at current job)

Climbing a corporate ladder just simply isn't worth it for us as a work force. It seems like companies milk their current staff for everything they have while keeping the pay the same and hire from the outside for higher positions, which doesn't make sense to me. In my mind, a worker who knows the details, since they used to do the work, would be more valuable. Is that not the case?"
935,"A lot of startup companies these days are also into hiring from a very young demographic pool. My previous company would hire kids as young as 21 right out of college and pay them vastly under the national average for those positions. They would get everyone to buy into the company culture and drink the koolaid so despite the fact that you're overworked and underpaid, at least its a ""fun"" place to work. They'll also try to entice people with equity options hence the crap pay.

I would say, as a personal rule, I wouldn't accept anything more than a 5-8k pay cut to work at a place that is chill. I would say as soon as the job is no longer chill for whatever reasons (i.e. denied raises), it would be time for me to move on."
936,"Apply anyway.   That's the point.  My old job even did that weed out those not willing to try and it's common place in the financial and banking industries.

941,"Aye. A lot of people, young and old alike, don't realize that you're interviewing the company just as they're interviewing you."
942,"So it is highly dependent on the industry but I dont think tenure and value is necessarily separate. A tenured individual knows the systems, the policies, culture, and many other aspects of a company that can make them more effective. They can possess more loyalty, and be trusted more. They can commit to long term strategic efforts and have some skin in them as they plan on being there to the end of those efforts. Now, should tenure be more than value? No of course not. I look at tenure as PART of value. The individual still needs to do their job and do it well. The move up and on mentality has been applied to too many area. Some fields it fits. Some it does not. Some people are just made to do a job. It fits them and they do it well and can continue to do it well for their entire career. I think of a technology consultant I knew. He was a rock star at it. GREAT with customers, great with getting us new business, and nobody executed on a project better than he did. He kept up to date on bleeding edge tech. He architected solutions that were brilliant. He was rock solid. He had no interest in going more into pre-sales, no interest in being a manager, and was cut for that while being 120% utilized and driving 4 separate opprtunities totaling more than $12 million. They saw him staying at the role he was awesome at as a weakness and we lost an awesome asset because of it. "

950,"Programming is actually quite simple and has more in common with logic than math or science. The problem is that programming and logic are usually not required courses, so kids don't have any exposure at a young age when their brains are still malleable. 

Painting/drawing isn't a good analogy because public schools generally don't teach proper technique until you get electives in high school (still not required).

Very few people are geniuses at drawing or programming. A lot of people are decently skilled. It takes practice, and the younger you started, the better."
951,"Re: Gamestop

Fellow humans: This is more than a meme. This is more than a way to earn a quick dollar. This is more than a way to fuck over rich people. This is a social movement. This is a grassroots push for a more equitable system. This is a way to expose corruption and greed. This is a way to force the system to change.

What happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market. They borrowed shares of Gamestop, sold them, and trashed the company publicly in an attempt to force Gamestop out of business. Aside from being wildly unethical, these wealthy people leveraged financial tools (short selling on margin/naked short selling) that only exist to make rich people richer. These tools exist for no other purpose. They do not add any value to our society. What they did is analogous to betting that your grandma will die, and then killing her yourself.

What does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down. It means that they stand to lose billions of dollars. It means that many of us “amateur” traders stand to permanently change our circumstances. It means we can afford rent and food without going into debt, buy our first house, pay off our student loans, pay for our kids’ schools, invest in our retirements, start small businesses, pursue a passion, PROGRESS in life. Perhaps most importantly, it provides us with a VOICE. 

What can you do: Identify and contact your local, state and federal representatives. Tell them that if anything fishy happens with the Gamestop situation, you will never ever vote for them again. Make your voice heard on social media. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that “these reddit people are crazy, this stock is worthless, innocent people are going to get hurt, this undermines the mechanics of the free market, etc.” That is all bullshit. The fact of the matter is, the wealthy people mentioned above are panicking, and are willing to say anything to undermine the cause and hold onto their ill-begotten wealth. 

If you like the $GME stock as much as I do, BUY IT AND HOLD IT. I am not a financial advisor, I am not “smart” enough. I am just a concerned individual who likes the stock.

So everybody, buy GME,

Cuz we need a little, controversy

And it feels so great with DFV!


Little Melvin! He's feeling rebellious, 

Embarrassed, we autists stole straight from his wealth chest, 

He starts feeling cuckholded and trollded

Till someone comes along and then yells out ""Go hold, bitch!"" 

A visionary! Vision is scary,

Could start a revolution, pollutin the share waves

A rebel, so just let me revel and bask in the fact that Mr. Chamath has got our backs

And it’s a disaster, such a catastrophe,

For wall street to see so much of my ass for free

Well we’re here- dananananananananana-

Get a diamond hand and hold it steady then we’re gonna

Bankrupt all these bitches like a fucking explosive

The hottest of potatoes, out in the open

It’s interesting, we’re just kids investing!

Ingesting our body weight in tendies!

Testing, attention please,

Feel my nest egg swelling when it’s 10 to 3

Here’s my 10k! Go buy all calls please

Who said “nuisance?” CNBC?


Now this looks like a job for me,

Just gimme a price and I’ll be there with a lambo lookin so nice

Yeah, I’m awesome, all bomb with my stocks cuz

Ever since july I’ve been on this concord!

But sometimes the shit just seems

Everybody wants to short my GME

So this must mean that we’re winning

Our stimulus is this vaccine!

No I’m not the first fund to bend the law, bud

I am the one who’ll chop the gorgon

And pop the bourbon while I shorten

These shorter’s futures be uncertain!

Here’s a concept that works

20 million other hedge fund shmucks emerge

But no matter how many fish in the sea

We’ll be swimming so free with DFV!"

[Question for the mods!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdnjql/_/gsawr67)

**4:00 Update**

At end of the day, GME ended pretty much where it ended yesterday. All things considered, GME is still in a really strong position. Today was not a bad day for GME.

I don't really have any good explanation as to what happened today without sounding like a conspiracy theorist. There are obviously a lot of things about the stock market I don't understand. That's why I'm a smooth brained ape. I apologize that I let things get out of hand.

I will do better.

Current price: 180.00

**3:41 Update**

I realized nobody knows what I'm referencing. [2018 North Carolina's 9th congressional district election. ](liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/eli.2019.0544). Absentee votes made no sense with the data we had available. They found out that the board was withholding certain absentee votes.

I really just want to understand the logic of how market orders works. Do they trade on the uptick or downtick? I've always assumed uptick but I have no idea. I've not been able to find anything that explains what the rules of that are. I want to better understand the rules of the game so I can play the game better.

I don't understand the rules that made today happen. I genuinely try to explain what the market is doing based on the data I see. Today is the first day where the data has made no sense to me. 

Current price: 177.91

**3:13 Update**

I want to be very clear. I'm not mad that GME went down. I'm not even mad that it's in the Red. I don't think that GME is in a bad position all things considered. I'm mad because there are some really strange patterns and coincidences going on that that I literally don't understand. None of the math makes sense to me anymore. I can't logically understand the narrative that explains what happened today unless it implies that the entire fucking economy is compromised.

The lack of transparency in the PUBLIC STOCK MARKET. How are we not able to double check the numbers to know that everything was valid? Why is everything so secret? 

I just want to know how many fucking shorts are in the market of the companies I'm looking to invest in. Why the fuck is that information impossible to find?

Current price: 173.03



**2:59 Update**

Russell 2000 is still matching GME. How. The entire fucking point of shit like the Russell is to take the composite of a large variety of stock so that it looks like a collection of all the stocks. Are you seriously telling me that all 2000 or however many stocks (I'm assuming that's what 2000 means) they have are trending the same way as Gamestop?

Y'all, I don't have an explanation as to what the fucks been going on. I'm literally too smooth brained to understand this. The only thing that comes to my mind would have implications so fucking crazy that I can't believe that they're true.

Current price: 172.88

**2:38 Update**

Seriously, can I get 538 or someone to do a statical analysis on the trades today? I literally don't understand how the velocity can change so sudden and be so consistent on literally the same level of volume. Was there some massive news that I miss? Is there mechanic of the stock market that I don't understand? Someone please help me.

Didn't we figure out that there was voting fraud because statical analysis of the votes showed that that possibility was so fucking insane that something was up?

Current price: 169.50

**2:30 Update**

How the fuck does this logically work?!?

From opening bell to 10:44 (74 minutes), GME traded 15,957240 shares. GME went up by 18.60 or up 9% from where GME started today. 

From that point on until 2:02 (191 minutes), GME traded another aprox. 15,957,240 shares. GME dropped $46.15 or down 22.4% from the price at 10:44.

I'm literally too smooth brained to understand this. Can anyone give me an explanation?

Current price: 169.50

**2:00 Update**

Let's talk volume. By the time this fall started (10:44), the volume was at 15,967,240. I'm keeping that for myself in case I need it for a future post.

Current price: 166.63

**1:47 Update**

I really refuse to believe that GME is such a big aspect of the Russell 2000 that it would copy GMEs trajectory. Either this is a coincidence, or they're manipulating the Russell 2000 to bring GME down.

I really can't comprehend that the HFs have so much unchecked power that they can move something like the Russell 2000. This has to be a crazy conspiracy theory, right?

I can't think of where else they're getting these shorts.

Any ideas anyone?

Current price: 171.29

**1:30 Update**

I feel like the Russell 2000 and GME are moving in the same direction for the most part. That feels interesting, though I don't have enough data to see if there's an actual correlation. If they're shorting the Russell 2000, that would explain where they're getting their shorts from.

I wish I could see the other ETFs and see how those numbers stack up with what's happened today.

Current price: 181.53

**1:23 Update**

So busy talking about my dog that I missed that GME went into the Red. There's still no volume though, so I expect that number to change if volume picks up. It seems a lot of people are waiting to see if GME will go any lower before they buy in today. I'm suspecting we'll have an interesting power hour.

Volume: 29,000,000

Shorts available: 10,000

Current price: 181.70

**1:17 Update**

As we wait for something interesting to happen, let me introduce you all to my good boy. [This is Banjo Mooseheart.](http://imgur.com/gallery/MlDhAOn) He is a Shepherd mix and lives a very hard life. He has many adventures and I plan to write a collection of those adventures in The Tales of Banjo Mooseheart. He loves peanut butter and running around the house. He's kept me sane over many stressful nights.

He's a good boy.

Current price: 183.29


**12:57 Update**

How much have volume slowed?

One hour into the day, we were at around 15,000,000 volume. Two hours and 15 minutes later, GME only got an extra 12,000,000 volume. This is a big reason that GME essentially stalled. This HFs were able to attack the stock during the low volume to destroy GME's momentum and bring it down, however they stopped their attack when they couldn't break into the Red. Because volume hasn't kicked back up, GME stalled where it's at now (around 190).

If HFs are out of ammo, and volume doesn't pick up, this is where GME will end up at the end of the day.

Again, GME has had a pretty traumatic week. If it ends up in the green, it'll go into next week with a ton of momentum. Calls ITM outweigh Puts so there should be that bump next week.

Next week's option chain is a monthly (not a weekly) so the stakes will probably be larger.

Also, HFs still need to close their shorts.

It wasn't the day many were hoping for, but I would still consider it a success for GME investors.

I still feel that 200 is reasonable.

Volume: 27,900,000

Shorts available: 7,000

Current price: 190.49


**12:29 Update**

Yes, yes. Shorts. I finally have some time to look at data. Forgive me for not reporting earlier.

A lot of shorts have been fired. Upward to 191,000 actual shorts and God knows how many synthetic shorts have been fired since this morning. Even with all of that though, GME is still in the green.

That's so fucking huge. As their ammunition runs low (is that even possible?) GME's upward trend should continue. Finishing above 200 seems quite reasonable.

Volume: 26,800,000

Shorts available: 9,000

Current price: 189.56

**12:17 Update**

Sorry for the slow updates. Works picked up a bit.

GME seems to have stalled close to yesterday's close. It seems that the HFs were able to stop the upward momentum, though they haven't been able to keep GME in the Red. Volume is still relatively low compared to this morning. 

Lunch hasn't really picked up. Moonshot is probably out of the realm of possibilities for today. Don't you dare assume that I'm saying the final squeeze is dead. I'm just saying that it probably won't happen today. It was a long shot anyways.

Even if GME stays here for the rest of the day though, it would be a huge statement for GME's resiliency after everything it's endured this week.

Volume: 26,400,000

Current price: 189.23

**11:54 Update**

GME rebound. It seems to have momentum, which should keep up if volume picks up again.

Current price: 190.43

**11:29 Update**

Holy fuck.

The onslaught continues. $30 in 50 minutes. However, the volume still doesn't match the first hour. We'll see if volume increases at lunch.

Volume: 22,000,000

Current price: 179.45

**11:04 Update**

GME keeps dropping, but volume hasn't kicked back up. Revised adjusted napkin math makes my estimate total volume at 67,925,000 which means that the volume in the past 30 minutes has been MUCH less than at opening bell. You can't legitimize a stocks price with that kind of volume. That's why the price goes up when the volume is up. The sample size at higher volume is more representative of the market' actual perception of a stocks value.

Please just close your shorts. I really don't think you're going to convince enough people with these scare tactics.

Volume: 19,800,000

Current price: 196.25

**10:52 Update**

Holy fuck. Did y'all see that? That strike took GME down nearly $10 in like 5 second. What a fucking missile.

If it falls, don't panic sell. continue to put in what you can, lowering your average share cost and weather the storm. I've always been to impatient, thought I learned my lesson but then I sold my AMC a few weeks before it took off after playing it for months. Yes I was in the green, but I would've been in the green about 7x more. I bought a bunch of marimed stock expecting to make a quick couple of bucks to dump back into AMC. I did and still am gaining from that call, but once again, I would've made A LOT more if I'd patiently hodled. Moral of the story.. Some boomer once said stock market is means of transferring banana from impatient monke to patient monke or something like that."
979,"A friend of mine, even though I begged him not to, sank all of his money (meaning everything in his bank accounts, and pawning his (deceased) father's watch) into GME the morning of January 29th. I told him to wait for a dip after all the nonsense from Robinhood, but he genuinely believed it was going to hit $10k the following week. He'd started moving money into RH earlier that week, and it took him a while to get everything tidy before he was ready to buy. 

At least I convinced him to hold for as long as he can, but he's down around 30% still. Sad part is he's not exactly wealthy, and he's had to stretch (and borrow a bit from me, which of course I don't mind doing) to make it work. 

Buyer beware. These memestocks are volatile, and you can't predict hype prices with 100% accuracy. Look at AMC this morning. I think it'll recover, but who knows? If you bought at $65 yesterday, you're probably not having a good morning. Just... realize that it's a gamble. I think some of them are **good** gambles, but I would never, ever, ever, **ever** recommend spending money you need for **food and f\*&\^ing shelter** on *any* investment. These are longer plays than you might think. 

Also, a lot of these new investors seem to think they just hit ""sell"" and money magically appears. Someone has to buy it. Just because the price is at $10k doesn't mean you can sell it for $10k. It could be less. Significantly less. It's more than just timing the top, it's timing the top and being able to sell what you want to at that price.

I want everyone to make money, and hope you all do. Just don't bet the damn farm on a meme."
980,"A kind, wise, caring post?? Where am I??"
981,"Edit: GET OUT NOW. AMC’s own words from the new prospectus: “Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.” Does that sound good to you? Ever heard a company tell you not to buy their own shares because you’ll lose all of it? 

I hate to say this, but some of you guys need to hop the hell out of AMC at market open. They are issuing 11,000,000 new shares, diluting existing stock, and I guarantee you that you are going to start seeing AMC insiders cashing out since AMC management holds a little over 7% of total stock. This is no GME where there was at least some substantial institutional shareholders like BlackRock. This thing has the potential to crash so hard and fast that you won’t have a chance to take profits. 

I’m proud of you guys and I hope new millionaires were made on here, but I’m warning you of what is possible."

If you OPTION a stock you bet it goes up or down with an OBLIGATION you BUY them if your bet is incorrect. If you option a stock, and it tanks or falls below your buy price you OWE.

Multiple sites showed a different end. I have everything consolidating to 200.27. That was fucking close. 

I'll make a more detailed recap of today at some point this weekend. I have a lot to process.

[The juggling continues](https://i.imgur.com/CxTGMBW.png), and so does GME's very slow descent. I'm honestly really impressed that they're still able to keep going. I wish I had access to more information to see what exactly is happening.

I still don't think that they'll make it below 200, but if the current velocity persists, it's going to be really fucking close.

Anything can happen. Enjoy the ride. Journey before destination.

It looks like they do indeed still have some firepower. The shorts available keep fluctuating by a few hundred every 15 minutes or so. I've never seen this since I've been keeping tabs on IBorrowDesk. They're essentially juggling desperately trying to get some sort of foothold.

45 minutes left. Can they somehow get it below 200?

This is starting to look eerily like what happened yesterday. Slow decline starting before 2, making it's way towards 200. Do they have enough firepower left to make this move again? If this goes like yesterday, we should see a spike down at around 3.

Happy Power Hour y'all!

**2:24 Update**

At this point, I'm going to have to assume that either they're getting shorts from ETFs or somewhere that doesn't report their availability. 5,700 shorts were borrowed, but I'm not sure if that amount would cause the current downward trend. We'll see how long this continues. I'll be impressed if GME drops below 200 again.

I don't know what the HFs are doing at this point. They took out another 2,000 shorts, but if anything, the price has bumped slightly up. There's still a of volatility, but it seems to still be stabalized around 213. We might see one more major price change before the end of the day, but don't be surprised if this is where we end up.

Shorts available: 6,000

Current price: 211.79

**1:25 Update**

Volume seems to be dying off, which means that the lunchtime rush has calmed. A lot of stuff has happened and GME is currently settled at around 212. A lot of changes have happened with the shorts available which I can't really pin down. They keep going up and down, but we're only taking about 1k amounts instead of the usual 100k amounts we've been seeing in the past. This makes pinning the shorts to stock movement difficult to guess. I'm still not 100% sure how much of the 12:30 run was shorts closing and how much was retail. Just as I'm not sure how much of the recent drop is from shorts being dropped and general retail selloff. 

Regardless, GME is in the green and would go into the weekend with a really strong position if it closes at this price point.

Shorts available: 9,000

Current price: 213.96

**1:04 Update**

I think the HFs are flailing and desperate to stop GMEs current climb. They're failing miserably.

I'm starting to believe that the 12:30 spike occurred due to shorts closing. Here's the thing, shorts available only climbed up 10,000. During that time? GME spiked up nearly $10.

I hope you all realize how fucking insane the implications of that are. If 7,000 shorts close and the price jumps up $10, what kind of jump will we see when MILLIONS of shorts close at this point.

Shorts available have since gone back down to 8,000, but GME continues to push back up to 220.

Shorts available: 8,000

Current price: 219.01

**12:52 Update**

GME has consolidated down to around 216. We saw this type of consolidation happen right after the 12:00 rally as well. Next round of people go to lunch at 1, so let's see if there's another spike at that point.

Remember when they were fighting for 200? 

Current price: $216.78

The fundamental value will be revised as the story for the company has changed: growth expectations are now higher ( e-commerce with DTC channels & huge marketing hype in the media to capitalize on), better financing with cheaper capital (private capital injections, low interest, high stock in public markets), new & more experienced board which may result in managerial changes, and lower opex from layoffs and closing of physical stores. Many of these factors were a “wet dream” just a few months ago. How would you price a global multi-channel specialty retailer with 5B in sales in the beginning of business transformation with abundance of capital? Probably not at 20$/share (ca.1.5B EV)...

Traded volume is just indicative of momentum. A number of exchanged stocks could easily be the same bunch of shares moved around."

BILLIONS WITH A ""B"". they will do literally anything to stop the squeeze. not financial advice and i could just be looking for ways to validate my not selling"
1025,"Hey  [u/smohyee](https://www.reddit.com/user/smohyee/) 

For argument #6: VW Squeeze

A couple of differences to point out. Back then it was one institution vs the whole Wall st, where as today it is retail against Wall st. Institutions don't like it when other institutions don't pay up but they would collude together to help rip off the retail investors. Also, it is way easier for one institution that owns 74% of all VW float to diamond hand (plus they publicly announced it to create a frenzy) than trying to coordinate 8M degenerates to hold on GME (half probably paper hand anyway). 

Because Porsche was trying to secretly take over VW alone, they were slowly buying up their shares, pushing up the price from 200 Eur to 400 Eur as a one-man show. No other fund agreed that VW was worth that much, especially with dwindling sales during a crisis/liquidity crunch in the market at that time, so they all decided to short it and it dipped by 50%. Jokes on the funds, Porsche came back out saying they were the majority owner of all the floats available, which left the funds who shorted it scrambling to cover their position, resulting in a short squeeze.

Lastly, VW was trading at 400 Eur before it spiked 2.5x to 1005 Eur. When GME went from $60 to $158, back down to $85 the next day then finally peaked at $468, that is almost 8x from the initial squeeze, way more than the 2.5x VW squeeze. And now they got RobbingHood and all the other brokerages manipulating it at full force, which was not a factor back in 2008.

I am a retard, I don't know what I'm saying. This is not financial advice"
1026,"A pattern I've noticed with the lot of people regurgitating the ""hold"" narrative is that their cost basis is under $50. The newer people here aren't as fortunate. At what point do these ""diamond hands"" become greed and turn into the very people we're fighting against?"
1027,"A lot of arguments. And there was no squeeze. There were just a bunch of people bidding up the side of a pyramid in expectation of one. You know not to say that on wallstreetbets.

What happens from this point is a Censored toss. It's not bad if you're in at $30.

So why are you holding smohyee?"
1028,"A squeeze happens when supply is significantly smaller than demand, the scenario of short covering we all envisioned was all shorts being required to cover at the same time due to a margin call. But what if they reshotted at $300? And what if they just bought the shares the other whales who pushed us through $150, sold over the last few days to take profit. That’s what I’m thinking has happened. Hedge funds closed their most dangerous sub $100 shorts for a huge loss then reshorted at the top to overall break even or lessen their total losses. Big players who rode this up don’t give a fuck about the “cause” they came to make money. Buying millions at $100-200 then selling from $300 down is a good way to make money for them."
1029,"A few counterpoints to consider:

* [S3 partners intentionally changed how they calculate SI % interest to manipulate public perception of shorts closing their positions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)

* [The ratio of short volume to total volume confirms the GME sell-off over the last few days is shorting, not real selling.](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/)

Thoughts?

I'm not a financial advisor, I love the stock."
1030,A tweet from Ryan Cohen would be great right about now.
1031,"Thank you, for fucks sake. I was down voted to oblivion for saying he had zero stake in GME, so why consider his opinion? People are saying it’s a sign of integrity, but literally all of these celebrity personalities have come and gone in an instant, while you are losing your money I. Chamath Got in and out at the peak. Belfort? A mouth piece."
1032,"The shares aren't really ""not real"". They are real but they have traded hands a lot. Take 4 people

A: Buys a share

B: Shorts a share, borrowing person A's share

C: Buys the share B sold

D: Shorts the share C bought. 

This creates 2 short positions based on 1 share sold. This isn't fake, this is how the market works. At the same time, technically A and C own the same share share, while C technically owns A's share its counted as 2 as well."
1033,"I read your report **A+**

@Diploma of 💎🖐️💎🦶🦍@"
1034,"Well said. The potential of a short squeeze was always secondary to DFV's DD, so I think the worshipping of his daily post as ""hE's StiLL iN"" misses the point. He A) got in at a price that leaves plenty of room for profit on fundamentals alone and B) already took quite some profit on the existing spike (that $13.7 mln cash in his account didn't come from nowhere). I would honestly bet he's ignoring the stock altogether until it reverts to fundamentals and his original DD comes back into play."
1035,"That's entirely possible.

It's also extremely slow to unwind without tapping into the free float.

D sells a retail share to cover C's short. C sells share to market. B buys C's share to return to A

The only way that ladder works is if the lenders of shares are also selling them back into the market.

So if you have a lot of short positions to cover which you're paying for, and you need shares and fast, there are two ways to do it:

* Saturate the market with buy orders and cover your ass at any cost

* Manipulate the market

A short can be covered by the purchase of a call. A call covering a short is allowed to be naked according to SEC rules. This is done into perpetuity and one way to create counterfeit shares.

We didn't see the market saturated with buy orders. I'm leaning towards the latter but only time will tell. I think they halted the markets because they saw they didn't have the sellers to exit their shorts like they wanted."
1036,A guy larping as a Viking on twitter got reposted like thirty times. People thought he was a legit billionaire without any proof.
1037,"Thanks for the response. Appreciated and agreed about naked shorts with call options to cover (making them technically not naked). I will note though, that if you have person A and C not selling, both B and D have no need to cover. Add to that if they have a long call, brokers see that as neutral and wont force B and D to buy from the float. So you in a way remain stuck by holding."
1038,"how the fuck can Robinhood, or any brokerage / clearance house operate a market while complitely dominated by what the DTC mandates AND not have a single clue of what the actual formula to determine capital requirements is ?   


What annoys me in this whole thing is that volume and price had been ripping upwards since the week prior, and DTC seemingly didn't change capital requirements. Only when it was really ready to explode they out of sudden increase it from 2% to 100%.   


A free market cannot exist without transparency."
1039,"You do know that the price climbed by an order of magnitude of \~25x in the past 30 days right?

A market cap shift of $48,000,000,000 at one point between December's low and January's high.

Last month, more than 1,200,000,000 shares of $GME changed hands. Yes, you read that right,  the \~50m float changed hands 25 times last month. You're telling me in all of that, the shorts wouldn't have been able to cover?

Melvin (who likely had the lowest cost average) claims to have been flat by mid morning Wednesday the 27th.

$GME opened on the 26th at $88.26 and was trading at \~$352 when Melvin Capital announced they were flat. The bulk of that price movement, while certainly fueled by retail, was exacerbated by Melvin (and several other shorts) covering (also reflected in other equity sell offs at the same time on the 26th and 27th). That price movement reflects $13.2b.

This entire situation over the last few weeks was exacerbated by other funds wanting in on the action both on the long side for the squeeze and the short side to try to bite off the squeeze near the top. Funds were lining up around the block for an opportunity to shore $GME anywhere north of $100 (and rightfully so).

The only way this thing can squeeze more (it's likely still very highly shorted based on S3 and other current data) is if retail momentum somehow sky's the price another 3x and scares out some of the smaller short positions that are in around the 200s. It will literally take 10s of billions of retail (or other) money to facilitate a follow up squeeze here.

And for the last f'ing time (not for you but for anyone reading this), the borrow rate and interest paid by shorts doesn't mean shit. Melvin Capital has had a short position in $GME since 2015. They operate on a very, very different timeline from WSB and retail and most of these funds will happily hold their shorts (even if underwater) for years or until RC convinces them that $GME will never die.

Not financial advise, just my 2 cents."

A few possible things: 

1. You don't have to be this strict with yourself forever from now on. Instead of going from $770/month to $42/month, you could give yourself a budget of say an average $100/month or so. (The exact amount of course should also depend on the urgency of your debts, and on your income). 
2. I would say: cigarettes are next! You might want to read up on which ways of kicking the habit work best. And consider spending some money on for example nicotine patches, as these might help you kick the habit in an easier way - given you a higher guarantee for success. Even if it costs you a bit of extra money in the first month or two, that investment can be very well worth it. 

Good luck!"
1055,"I have a family of 5 and spend $866.67. We live in rural Massachusetts, so food is typically priced. A gallon of Milk is $2.89 for reference. 

* Breakfasts: We have chickens and eat a lot of eggs. Oatmeal is a staple. 

* Lunch: The kids get free lunch at school, but when they are home, they eat leftovers or a sandwich (meat and cheese or PB&J). They love ramen, but I try to limit it for health reasons. Same for mac&cheese&hotdogs (though I did just purchase a bulk bag of natural cheese powder on amazon, so this will happen a lot in summer)

* Dinners: We eat a lot of rice and beans. We eat a lot of vegetables (I try to grow them, but savings are negligible). We have a vegetarian dinner 1-2 times a week. Meat is usually whatever is on sale. I pay for one of those shopping list/weekly menus where they match the sales to recipes (bonus, it gets my husband to share the burden of cooking).

A year ago this month, I was helping her to the bathroom because she was too weak to go.  Keep in mind two weeks earlier she was strong enough to do cartwheels if she wanted to,  the next morning she wasn't moving in the bed, my sister didn't want to go in there, she feared the worse, I checked her pulse, it was cold,  she died with her eyes open and it wasn't a pleasant way to die.  I closed her eyes, so my sister wouldn't freak out.  My father was an asshole, and I couldn't care less other than he helped make me, but he also died from lung cancer and from what I'm told, it was much worse.

The guy couldn't pay his rent and got all kinds of overdraft fees while he was waiting.

1118,"Yes, I phrased my response poorly. A lot of companies do this. Amazon, Runescape, Spotify, just to name a few I use that do. I more so meant displaying the entire card number, not just the last four. My bad."
1119,"Good God. Yeah that is definitely scary. A lot of cool tech has been shown to me by others that could prevent this, but it's scary knowing some companies just don't do it."
1120,">  It is gone. A credit card allows the owner some recourse when it is used fraudulently. This is what I have always believed is true. If someone out there can tell me differently, I am all ears.

There's some truth but especially as you phrase it it's a significant exaggeration into untruth. I'm assuming US in all of this.

First, you have legal protections against fraudulent use of your debit card. If you notify your bank within 48 hours of you knowing your card is lost, stolen, or used fraudulently, your liability is limited to $50; if within 60 days, then it goes up to $500. Saying you have no recourse is just wrong under the law.

Second, many banks go beyond this and offer better protection than what the law requires. I don't think it's infrequent to see that dropped to $0. That especially holds true if the fraudulent transaction was run ""as credit"" instead of ""as debit""; i.e., was processed via Visa/Mastercard/etc.'s network instead of as an ATM transaction. In those cases, I think Visa and Mastercard both have a zero liability guarantee (without the 48 hour limit the law requires).

Now, why is it only an exaggeration and *bordering on* untruth? Because in practice, there are ways in which debit cards leave you more exposed, beyond just what is implied by the above rules.

First, your money is withdrawn immediately. This leaves you short, can cause checks and other payments to bounce, etc. when they try to post before you notice the fraudulent transaction. In theory this isn't really different from a fraudulent transaction using more of your credit limit (e.g. *that* could also cause payments to bounce, as could a change in card when you get a replacement), but in practice (i) it'd be harder and (ii) they're probably less important transactions in the CC case (e.g. not rent). (On (i), people usually have waaaay higher credit card limits than checking account balances.)

Second, what happens *after* you notice? With a credit card, if you report a fraudulent transaction they'll remove it from your account while investigating. With a bank and a debit card transaction, they'll *usually* do this but not always, and they're not required to do so. This means that in a ""worst case"" scenario, you could be out your money for *weeks* during the investigation.

Third, depending on how big of a stickler the bank wants to be and the nature of a transaction, they're probably a little less likely to rule in your favor in their investigation. This particularly goes for PIN transactions -- you'll see posts from people here from time to time where they had their number skimmed, and their bank said ""well the transaction was done via your PIN so it must have been you."""

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

1134,"Thank you.

I sadly do not have money to comitt, as I have money they I wouldn't want a return on (and any money tossed in I would view as Gone.)

However. I am trying to signal boost to see if those around me in meatspace can chip in. One thing many around me have in common. A deep and abiding hatrid for how rigged the game is.

Time to break the machine."
1135,A straw ain't bad. Makes it feel like I'm on the islands.
1136,I disagree. A sale is independent of the intention to buy something.
1137,"Not to sound pedantic, but I feel you’re somewhat mistaken. A person saves money so long as they buy the item for less than what their minimum willingness to pay is. 

For example, I bought Monster Hunter World for $30 yesterday. Now, I had no plans to buy it at the regular $80, and under your logic, I wasted my money because I wouldn’t have normally bought it at that price. However, I was willing to pay up to $40 for the game, so I still took advantage of the sale to a tune of $10. 

Not sure if that made sense lol.

I do agree though, that if a person goes into the store and only buys something because they save money on it, then that is a waste."
1138," A lot of these sales are BS anyway.  I still remember going to HMV a week before and there were some games marked at $20 and $10.  I went back on Black Friday, ALL the games were marked at $20, even games I knew had been $10."
1139,"I went last night to buy sheets while they were on sale. They were $24. I decided to look at other sheets in linen aisle and found character sheets the exact size and set I REALLY wanted on clearance for $7 because they were the last ones. Haha Wal-Mart who is laughing now!? I am so smart I am so smart S-M-R-T, I mean, S-M-A-R-T!"
1140,"This is why i find BF to be hilarious. All these people buying crap they don't need because theyre ""saving"" money. Here's the kicker alot of this stuff is on sale throughout the year even better prices. A fool and their money are quickly parted"
1141,"**Patience & delayed gratification is what is necessary for Black Friday/Boxing Day**

* I save gift money (Christmas, Birthday, bonuses, tax refunds) for Black Friday shopping. Through out the year I create a list of items I want to buy, and I wait for a good deal. (Notably I don't have any consumer debt, otherwise I would direct extra funds towards that.)

* I also purchase staple consumable items on Black Friday. A year's worth of shampoo, hand soap, skin care items, batteries, etc. 

* It's also a great time to buy heavily discounted food, that lasts months. Frozen turkey or ham. Cheeses. Shelf stable foods. Baking supplies....  And butter (I freeze butter). 

* Be hyper critical of purchasing items that were not on your 'want to buy' list prior to seeing a deal. Impulse shopping is not what you want to be doing. 

* If you make an impulse purchase, do not be afraid to return the item for a refund. "
1142,"I think it’s safe to say the majority of people going into a crowded store on black friday are there not because they need to get something but because they want to be there to “see what they find”. 

If my living room tv broke and I need to buy a new one, i’ll be damned if I’m going on a black friday. Oftentimes, those incredible deals on those doorbuster items are black friday specific items that they would not carry otherwise. A 55” inch OLED for $300? It’s a shitty model with a shitty refreshment rate and a slow ass processor. Meanwhile, the awesome model is $600, and it’s probably been at that for a few weeks and will continue to be at that price all through december."
1143,A good deal on something you don’t need is neither good nor a deal. 
1144,"A lot of times I don’t realize that I wanted something until I find it at the store on sale. If you end up using the product and not just shelving it, then you saved money regardless of whether you wanted it before entering the store or not"
1145,"Hell, just being more usable during the same lifespan. A worthwhile computer make a major quality of life difference."
1146,"I almost always suggest people spend closer to $800 to $1000 on a laptop. A laptop in that range will give you a much better experience and will last longer than the alternative. I guess this is only applicable if you spend a considerable amount of time on your computer, but I still think if you can afford it, shelling out the extra few hundred makes the experience and longevity that much better.

But, of course, a budget is a budget."
1147,"Yeeeeessss. A sheet for gifts, like each tab a person or household. A sheet about house stuff needed, one for clothes, etc. I stalk all the sales all the time"
1148,"Thing is if you think of it this way, you're already thinking about a new phone while no you don't need one right now. You will end up replacing it eventually. Now the question is, is it a waste of money if you'll eventually get it anyways? What if you're looking for a pair of speakers but you can't see spending (speaker price). A couple months go bye and while looking for other things on sale you find those speakers at a much more reasonable price, does it worth grabbing the speakers? 

Now obviously if your just grabbing things that you don't need or have never thought of it's simply a waste. Unless that un-thought of thing will become essential (As in a knee brace on sale for someone with knee pain)"
1149,"I'm not sure how it is in the US, but you should see Norway. For some reason, every store here has gone all in on Black Friday. It doesn't matter how new the product is, you'll find some deal on it.

Samsung Galaxy S9+, at about a price of $900 a week ago? $500-600 now.  Brand new samsung 4k TV's? 50% off, sometimes more. 

And you don't even have to stress at all, most stores have the same offers online. And at the same time, it isn't really Black Friday here anymore, it's more of a ''Black Week''.  A lot of stores have the same offers the whole week, while some add offers every day etc.

You can literally save 50% off anything you could ever want, if you just buy it on Black Friday. "
1150,"I thought you were referring to that joke that gets reposted here from time to time.  A wife sees a sign, ""Oh wow, we can save 50% off of a XXXX.""  The husband says, ""Just keep walking, and you can save 100%.""  "
1151,"SKU is always internal, UPC is global.  A more reliable, legible indicator is the classic ""model number"".  Best Buy's SKU being unique is irrelevant if you can demonstrate that the UPC is the same, in fact it would be a weird thing to learn that any SKU for a particular product at best buy matched the SKU for the same product model at any other retailer.    If you had a store you could make a SKU just ""ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"" or whatever else you wanted but that wouldn't make it a different product.

I think what you're describing is that the model # is actually different for certain retailers, and there is in that case no guarantee that it's the same product.  Some appliance retailers for example will order the same fridge that everyone else sells but without the water filter.  And sell it a little cheaper, but you will find a little difference in the model # and it's not exactly the same product.  So when a product at a certail retailer has a different model # it's completely fair to wonder whether certain features have been left out for cost-saving reasons while appearing outwardly to be the model that has all the features of the generic model #.  Or whether certain features have been added that the retailer thinks are worth it, like a laptop that comes with a best buy program preloaded.

I worked at an electronics place and don't do that anymore but now work sales at a business to business wholesaler, so my source is just what I've learned but I think I've got a pretty good grounding"
1152,"You're wrong. Someone (not Brad trading on his phone and posting on Reddit) bought 900k shares at the bottom in less than 60 seconds.

So basically the reverse of what you are saying happened. The manipulator, or group of manipulators, bought $90 million worth of GME at the exact bottom, largest volume spike of the day, nearly a million shares in a minute ,and pushed it up 300% an hour after their purchase. The complete opposite of what you are saying happened.

Obviously a big player, someone using high tech (probably AI) or whatever, very professional manipulation.

Not Brad guessing the bottom by looking at his phone to buy 100 shares and brag about it on the Internet.

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

1154,A hundred year ago the trustees of banks would have been hung in public for the same crimes those people committed. Violating the the trust of people and devaluation of money for self benefit. (Paraphrasing there a bit) Now they get bailed out and patted on the back and the country the people pay. Not right. What was done was illegal and they should be appropriately punished. IMO
1155,"I saw three different CEO's say this yesterday. 

I just have one question: why could people sell? They said they did this to make it so that when people sell they can still get their money. That's where I get confused. 

I get that when people buy or sell they do it with these ""middlemen"" clearing houses before actual people so that all the stuff that has to happen behind the scenes can resolve a day or two later. if so many people are buying and selling then there's a backup/overlap of this money that has to sit there for a couple days. 

The amount of money that has to sit there is normally a small percentage of the actual stock value but for these stocks the service that these clearing houses use set it to 100% causing the amount of liquid required to be insanely high

I think my understanding is right here

My question is why were people still allowed to sell? Who was buying it? And why were some platforms still able to buy? They say this service rose the % because of the volatility. Why would this incredible volatility make them want to do this?

A couple of the CEOs said that the clearing houses were buying the stock that people were selling. One of them said that they were buying it so they don't lose money because the hedge funds weren't able to resolve their short position and now it's up to them. 

That's where we're at. After all of that explanation, it still seems that this was done so the clearing houses don't get screwed by the shorting that can't be covered."

1158,"""I purchased for a dollar, my stop loss was at 40 cents on that dollar. *I just did not wish to lose it all this time.* ""  -- There's the problem right here, you need to learn from this and never do it again.

   A 40% stop is pretty deep. Imagine you're holding $5000 in your hands. You make the decision to buy GME. You pull the trigger and commit to the trade. When you set a 40% stop, that means you were *mentally and financially prepared* to immediately walk to the end of the driveway and throw $2000 in the trash can, and be totally okay with that.

After studying the company, chart pattern, volatility, leadership or whatever is important to you personally, did you think the upside was $1.80? $2.20?  Those would be 2:1 and 3:1 risk profiles.  Was the upside 100:1? How much were you willing to risk and *WHY*? You need to develop a set of strict trading rules for every trade you make and stick to those rules.

GME has horrible fundamentals due to bad management, an archaic business model, and they failed to pivot soon enough to compete with Steam. The had no vision or observation of how the world was changing, rooted in an archaic software sales model and that makes it a bad investment. It deserved to be destroyed.

A STOP is there to guard your risk. Look at how the stock moves over time, find a place where the chart shows it sort of bounces off of (""support"") then put your stop a little below that. But if you can't see an upside of 2 or 3 times, don't trade it.  

No serious money should be used to play GME.  If it's money that's important to you, invest in the S&P500 or NASDAQ index funds a bit each year, and don't look at them for 20 years."

Especially during the 2008 crisis. my dad spent his entire life tobacco farming and throwing money into the stock market. He lived well-to-ok for the first 70 years of his life only to sell the farm he grew up on in 2010 and now lives off of a social security check and worked until COVID.

1167,"> Every time we finally get a bit of relief economically for a couple years, something comes and fucks it up ROYALLY....Usually they (elites) are behind it somehow.

on purpose, so the rich can steal our money.  Housing crash/2008 crash was entirely intentional, and resulted in the largest rent seeking economy ever.  Even now, waves from 2008 are still hitting, housing going to rentals, rent going up everywhere because houses are being bought by rental companies.  I have had 4 people in the last year come and offer to buy my house for 1.5 to 2 times its appraised market value, only so they can turn around and rent it.  The problem is that i could not get shit for a home for that same money.  

The other half, is that rent is getting so high, that no one can afford it, since wages didn't keep up(intentionally, again), so there are literally millions of homeless people, and more than enough empty houses to house every single homeless person in the USA, and *yet*, I see more and more ""new"" housing being made, but not a single one of it is affordable.  A college rental owner/management company just opened a 250 bed ""apartment"" with common amenities.  A single bedroom goes for $1300 per month.  in a city with the median wage of just 29000.  like, WTF, how are these kids paying for their housing, except with student loans...."

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

Every sell is a gasp of air to keep them from drowning, let them sink.

* They have short sold 78% of the existing stock.

* Short selling is borrowing a share and selling it at current price. You pay interest on that borrowed share. To cover your short position, you buy a share and return it to the lender.

* If the price of the stock increases, then this will cause a short squeeze.

* A short squeeze is when the lender loses confidence that the short position will be able to cover. This results in the lender calling back their share, forcing the short position to cover. When the short position covers, i.e., when they buy a share, this creates upward pressure on the stock's price. As the price goes up from the short position covering, more and more lenders will lose confidence thereby forcing more and more short positions to cover and so on.

* For GME, a short squeeze would mean that the short positions will be forced to buy 78% of all existing shares.

* The end result is that the price will explode and holders of GME stock can exit with a large profit.

* Note: If a stock has Short Interest (SI) above 30% then it is considered heavily shorted. GME's current SI is that 78% number.

* Note 2: That number is *purportedly* accurate as of 29 January 2021. It is possible that the short interest has gone up, down, or is unchanged. I would hypothesize that is has gone up which is represented in the strong downward (sell) pressure on the stock's price.

* Note 3: I say *purportedly* in Note 2 because it is possible that the short positions have been [obfuscated](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf) through a taking a synthetic position called a [synthetic long asset](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/synthetic-long-asset/).

* Note 4: I forgot to mention that a short seller makes money when the short seller covers (buys the stock to return to the lender) at a price lower than the price that the stock was short sold at. A short seller loses money when they cover at a price higher than the price they short sold at. As a result, the short seller can make as much as the difference between the price of the stock at the time of short selling and 0 and can lose as much as the difference between the price of the stock at the time of short selling and infinite (because there is no theoretical upper limit to the stock's price)."
1203,MORNING KEN. YOU'RE A HUGE PUSSY
1204,"🚀 **Good Morning Everyone**

🚀 **Live Thread**

**The most important step that you can take is always the next one.** 

**8:36 Sneaky Update**

Gamestop broke 190. I'm bringing a spare pair of underwear tomorrow.

Current price: 192.08

**4:00 Update**

Dear Hedge Funds,

Today, people owning more than 49,000,000 shares agree that the value of GME is at least $183. That represents more than 116% of the current float.

Close your fucking shorts.

We'll talk again tomorrow.

Current price: 183.26

**3:25 Update**

Maybe no 200 today. That's fine. GME made such amazing progress today which could continue tomorrow as well. We haven't seen any ability from the HFs to slow this growth. GME is so fucking strong.

Current price: 181.80

**3:20 Update**

It might hit 200. It would be so fucking huge if GME ends above 200. 40 minutes left, and I still feel like there's a small possible chance.

Current price: 180.21


**3:00 Update**

Seriously. If GME hits 200, the situation would literally have been -

Everyone: GME is worth at least 200

Earnings Report

HF: GME is worth less than 120

Everyone: Fuck that, it's worth at least 200

How the fuck do the HFs react to that?

Current price: 182.42

**2:55 Update**

GME wanted power hour to start early. If GME hits 200, it would cement GMEs price legitimacy there, and I have no idea how the HFs would be able to convince anyone that it's not worth at least that. This is an absolute monster of a day for GME

Holy fuck.

Current price: 182.11

**2:46 Update**

I know when I made a typo when I saw my messages blow up. Please forgive me. I do all of this on my phone at work and most of these updates are quick jots.

GME might be starting a move up?. Power hour coming up. Moonshot needs some stupid stuff to happen in order for it to even be possible.

Current price: 171.00

**2:25 Update**

GME is still stalled at 265. There's about a $5 volatility swing which makes sense after the past two days. Volume has been relatively low.

Volume: 39,000,000

Current price: 164

**1:54 Update**

I have this weird feeling that there's going to be another large swing before the end of the day. The volume velocity has slowed drastically since this morning. Will see see another volume spike at power hour?

Regardless, tomorrow is shaping up to be another huge battle. After everything they've done, I don't know if the HFs can afford losing the ITM call/put spread this week. If GME ends up above 200, their entire plan for this week would've been a huge failure.

Volume: 38,000,000

Current price: 161.95

**1:40 Update**

Forgive me for the messy data. I had to pull the info on my phone, put it in excel on my work computer, crunch the numbers, take a picture on my phone, go outside to upload on mobile data, then update before I had to get back from lunch.

The green marks are the price points I'm looking at as significant milestones.

I'm trying really hard to make sure I don't get fired.

Current price: 169.28

**1:36 Update**

Volume is currently at around 36,000,000. GME broke 170 again. It doesn't really move without volume, but once the volume is there, the price flies up.

How much more volume will we get? We'll find out.

Volume: 36,000,000

Current price: 173.27

**1:20 Update**

Sorry y'all. I was doing math. [Here is the current options picture.](https://imgur.com/gallery/DQAsPUD) The balance point was actually 160, which GME has crossed. The next big step is 200, where the total ITM number jumps. As you see, the further GME goes, the more the call options pile on. If there's another huge jump before the end of the day, the Moonshot is still possible.

As long as GME ends above 160 tomorrow, the calls will outweigh the puts which will continue to drive buying power into next week.

Current price: 167.35



**12:30 Update**

GME has stalled because volume has stalled. We haven't seen a lunchtime bump. I'm assuming that it's probably not going to happen at this point. As y'all can see, GME is still to far away for the pendulum to swing on its own. I would anticipate at least one more major move before the day is over. The Moonshot is still possible, but it would need a few more pushes like we had this morning. If this kind of momentum continues through tomorrow though, GME could get back above 200 by the end of the week.

A lot of stuff can still happen.

Volume: 30,000,000

Current price: 155.87

**12:04 Update**

GME has hit it's first major stall. Lunch time is starting for the east coast so we'll see if things pick back up. I'm really impressed with what's happened so far today. Even if it ends in this area, it would be a great response to yesterday.

Volume: 27,800,000

Current price: 158.03

**11:35 Update**

We broke yesterday's volume.

What if people go to lunch, see the price, and FOMO in? Today's gone perfectly for GME so far, and that would be GMEs most hilarious next step.

Volume: 23,000,000

Current price: 164.25

**11:28 Update**

I took a precautionary shit. Thank God because I come back to see GME break 170. We've almost broken yesterday's volume only two hours into the day.

Holy fucking shit GME is strong.

Current price: 170.23

**11:21 Update**

GME broke 165. GME is so fucking strong right now. I'm getting Goku going Super Saiyan vibes right now.

Holy fuck

Volume: 18,000,000

Price: 165.32

**11:11 Update**

Y'all. Volume is at 16,000,000. GME broke 150 and is halfway to 190. It's currently on pace to barely hit 60,000,000 by the end of the day. The Pendulum Moonshot is still most likely not going to happen, but I still can't rule it out of the realm of possibilities. This kind of pace needs to continue for the rest of the day in order for it to MAYBE happen. 

Current price: 153.99

**10:56 Update**

Volume is already at 12 million. GME continues to push up when volume goes up.

As far as my theory is concerned, GME needs AT LEAST 60,000,000 volume if not more for GME to be on pace to do this. I don't know if volume will stay strong. As of now though, I still haven't ruled it out as impossible.

Current price; 145.20


**10:44 Update**

Just to clarify, my theory is not a prediction, I'm just saying that I can see it as a possibility if everything lines up. I'm order for this to happen, it will probably take all of the day today and tomorrow to fully materialize.

Right now, I still see it as a very small possibility. I'll literally shit myself at my desk and quit my job if that happens.

Current price: 141.86

**10:26 Update**

This is theoretical and may contain many assumptions that may be wrong. I am not predicting anything. Over lunch I'm going to do some math to be more exact, but last I checked, the total ITM Call put spread balance point was 190. That's where the Call ITM percentage swing changes from negative to positive. If today becomes a massive day, we would potentially see the pendulum swing accelerate towards 190. If that acceleration does happen, the total ITM options expands as you go beyond 200. So like a pendulum, it should accelerate, but once it crosses the 190 threshold, the gravity of growing calls should continue pulling GME up. 

Please don't excited, this probably won't happen, but it is definitely a possibility.

Current price: 138.22

You see, $1000 -- $10,000, that's the price of lunch to a some of the hedge fund managers. But it's potentially life altering to some of us. We can get there pretty easily with what we have in GME -- and if we lose our ass, well, we're out some months of money. We just don't have as much on the line, individually, as a hedge fund -- a singular entity -- that's on the hook for $100 million or more if things don't go their way.

We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. A few (even a few dozen) share's worth of money isn't going to make or break anyone -- but multiplied by the number of apes there are, and the limited risk of bankruptcy or disaster we all have, well -- they're well and truly fucked ~~if~~ ***when*** this goes our way.

1218,"Here's another important tip I learned a couple of days ago the hard way:

When you decide to freeze you credit, give a it quick look **BEFORE** you freeze it unless you have very recently checked it.  


If you wait until afterwards (as I stupidly did) it's a lot harder to check that everything is OK going into your freeze.  A quick check with Credit Karma, for example, is simply refused because of the locks, and the main 3 seem to require a letter requesting the info."

Now we have to jump through loops to protect ourselves because of their incompetence and pay them to freeze and later unfreeze our credit. This is 5 companies × 140, 000,000. There's no guarantee that they will not get hacked again because the people at the top knows diddley squat nor care or decided the extra measures will take away from the bottom line. I feel they are just trying to sale a false since of security while covering their asses from future lawsuits. So when all is said and done and a few years from now when this happens again we are just going to have to bend over. In the words of our former great leader "" fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again."" End rant. "
1221,"> I didn't realize it's a a credit agency prerequisite to be willing to exploit millions of people in their time of need.

Credit bureaus have always been the literal worst, and I am glad they are finally getting shit on for their sleazy/negligent tactics. We are not their customers; we (and our personal information) are their products. 

They don't care about us, and don't do anything they aren't strictly legally required to do for us. A good credit score is of vital importance these days, and these guys control it, and goose the numbers to incentivize borrowing and maintaining huge credit lines. If you've ever tried to clean up your credit after ID theft, you know how awful they are.

 "
1222,"Police here: We hate this policy. We get called to countless people's houses for police reports because the credit bureau/bank demands them. And for what? A report which solely consists of the information provided to us by the complainant.  Nothing more. But somehow it legitimizes your claim in their eyes. No crime is getting solved, no one's going to jail, and there is, in most cases, absolutely nothing we can do to help the situation except give you a pamphlet redirecting you back to the same credit bureaus that got you into this mess. It's insanity. You're not freezing your credit for fun, you're doing it because something is seriously wrong. That should be the end of the conversation with them. But I digress."
1223,"Speaking of - I wonder if I can get through Equifax website/automated phone yet.

edit: NOPE. I can get through EXCEPT neither system will process my request. Instead they are now routing everyone to a Sys. Error 500 and stating you need to mail your request in.

In other words, YOU CANNOT FREEZE YOUR ACCOUNT IN A TIMELY MANNER right now which, for the first time since this whole incident began, pisses me off."
1224,"A place I have to call semi-regularly does this intentionally.  It says ""we are experiencing higher than normal call volume, please call back later"", and disconnects you.  No option to hold."
1225,A credit reporting agency doesn't make consumer credit decisions. They just keep track of information and provide that information to whoever pays for it.
1226,"Of course they do. Where do you think your credit score comes from? TransUnion and the others each have their ""secret sauce"" way of deciding how all the information they have translates into a specific credit score. (That's why you may have slightly different scores for each agency.)

A credit score, in turn, is that credit agencies guess as to how credit worthy you are. A score of 800 means ""give this person lots of credit."" A score of 500 means ""Stay away from this person and do not loan them money.""

That score is a *subjective decision* about how credit worthy you are, given all the information they have. (Subjective meaning they decided how to weight the formula.)

When a landlord pulls your credit, the credit agency doesn't in any way ""provide that information"" to them raw -- how does a landlord know what to do with that? Instead they provide that single number (and a few other highlights). The landlord mostly just looks at that single number and makes a decision.

For something like a mortgage it's even more cut-and-dry. A bank may not extend a mortgage if your score is below X, or alternatively they may change the rate by Y%.

But that score is absolutely a decision on the part of the credit agency, and certain institutions may find that they ""trust"" the score from one of the big three more than others (i.e. they think your 760 score from TransUnion is a better predictor of whether you'll default than you 780 score at Experian), and use that one more. That's why there's more than one -- they're in competition with each other."
1227,"Thanks for this, you made it easy, my experience as a NY State resident: I started at 1130pm, finished before midnight. 

TransUnion: 10 mins, create an account, username/password and pin, enter personal info and answer random security questions from credit history, confirmed freeze.

Experian: 5 minutes, enter personal info, answer random questions from credit history, was assigned a pin with confirmation of freeze.

Equifax: 5 minutes, entered personal info, was asked if I was certain I wanted to freeze, checked yes, was assigned a pin with confirmation of freeze.

Ridiculous not to even try to confirm I am who I am. Anyone, A..N..Y..O..N..E.. with my name, address and social could have frozen my credit! 

Now Im even MORE annoyed at Equifax on top of everything else. Clearly negligent. "

1229,"Hedge funds are not long term investments.

1230,"I have most of my savings in VOO. Even the recent correction, it is still up over 20% for the last year and my annualized return is over 15%.  

A very close friend who manages a hedge fund told me ""buy VOO, reinvest the dividend, ignore the stock price until you are about 5-8 years from retirement, and never invest in a hedge fund"" It was the best investment advice I have ever been given and I pay for his drinks whenever we are out. "
1231,"This has been known for decades, and no one here yet seems to understand why people still go with hedge funds.

It's true that there are people who buy into hedge funds because of promised higher returns by the managers, but more knowledgeable people (ie the mega-rich, institutions or pension funds) typically go with a hedge fund because of their specific needs, and a hedge fund's capacity to deal with them. For example, pension funds are mandated by legal and moral obligations to be able to pay out $x for y number of people in z years time. 

While it's true that most ordinary citizens are better off with index funds if they simply want to maximize their wealth, in the real world shit can happen and a simple portfolio of index funds doesn't offer much protection. For example, a family with an older member  likely to pass away in the next decade and pass their estate down wants to ensure that their two children will be able to afford college when they grow up. A pretty typical situation and need, but one that still often requires input from a financial manager.

Scale that one family up to a mega rich family, or an institution, or a pension fund that is required to ensure comfortable lives for the retired and it's easy to see why hedge funds, even with lower returns and high fees, are desirable. 

"
1232,"Simplest? Yes. Most efficient? No. There's really bad advice here in response to your question, so please, at least listen to me and think on this yourself. Index funds are one part of a good investment strategy. Yes, Warren Buffet sings their praises, but if anyone believes that Warren Buffet puts all his money in index funds, much less a single index fund, they're an idiot.

Even if you're years out from retirement, you still want a diversified portfolio. The bulk of your portfolio would most likely be stocks, but it's not as simple as putting all of your ""stock"" money in an index fund if you want to be well diversified. Your ""stock"" money should be further broken down into categories of domestic and international, and then broken down again into large cap, mid cap, and small cap, and then you should also look at value funds vs. growth funds and decide based on your own goals what mix you want of the two.

You should also have money in other categories as well, like bonds, real estate, and cash (always have some cash in your portfolio so you can buy in on a great deal), 

People on here act like it's okay and expected to lose 10 years of investment performance when the market tanks as long as you're going to keep your money in there and let it rebuild. It's true, but it's lunacy. There's no reason you have to lose your shirt every time the market tanks and start over again. A well diversified portfolio will accomplish that. 

The only difference when between when you're 40 years out from retirement instead of 10 years out is what percentage of your portfolio is allocated to each category of investment.

"
1233,A Coke for breakfast? I know who's getting rich; it's Warren Buffett's dentist.
1234,"Opposite right?  An index fund is the ""safe"" bet in that it's theorhetically markdt performance.  A talented hedge fund can take more risks moving away from a well diversified market portfolio if they have a special ability to predict market movements or identify undervalued stocks."
1235,"You're right that an actively managed fund should be able to react to the market quickly, but I'm not sure people are clear on the terms being used here... A hedge fund (what Buffet was talking about) is very different from a mutual fund (what most of us actually invest in). A hedge fund's goal is aggressive growth, so it's inherently stacked with riskier bets/investments. These funds and their managers excel in hot markets, and they typically don't take defensive positions. It's all about finding the growth, so when you have an overall market downturn, it will hit a hedge fund much harder than it would a mutual fund. The other thing to know is that hedge funds usually aren't available to your average investor anyway. They're only available to the ultra-wealthy (minimum $500,000 investment in the fund) and people who manage large pools of retirement funds, like pensions."

1241,"Ah. A reasonable response. The whole system is based on the mutually held belief, or trust, that money, materials or labour are worth trading or using which could change at any moment. But my conception of their worth to other people differs from their own. Prices and values are relative and ever changing and can only be measured after the fact. It's plausible that money could become worthless in a catastrophe.

He could very well stop communicating with the outside world, the cash could become worthless but he would still value it as long as he believed it was worth something. Is it? Only to him. Is that ""rational""? 

He has held a belief for 40 years that there was a huge crash coming any moment. Is that belief rational? It's irrational in retrospect but for someone who went through WWII as a child, it's very rational. Or is it?

Assuming a neoclassical economic mathematical framework in a general way to simulate the behavior of complex human beings in an uncertain, ever changing world is not really robust, to put it mildly. I just think that some of the key assumptions of mainstream neoclassical economics are dubious at best. "
1242,"Yeah, it's ridiculous and screams fraud (although it might not be).

In any event, it's not ""investing"" as the term is normally used.  It's an [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Strategies) fund.  

From what I've read over the years it works like this:  Stock exchanges are now, of course, 100% computers.  The exchanges exist on servers which are located in different areas across the country.  

When you put in a buy/sell order, your broker will relay this order to the various servers.  What Renaissance does is, it has top-of-the-line direct internet connections to the various servers.  So it will, say, see you want to buy some stock on Server A.  It then goes and buys that stock on servers B, C, and D before *your* buy order even gets to those servers over the network.  It then relists it for a small profit-- and sells it to you.

So it's basically a form of frontrunning using network latency.  Virtually risk-less.

Their argument to regulators is that this is providing market liquidity."

1244,"Human studies can be tricky, but in this case I don't think there's any ethical problem in asking for volunteers to report on the circumstances (date, any special occasions, and any related circumstances of events that the deceased was looking forward to) of a loved one's death.

A study for this could be almost pure survey, no harms done."
1245,"Definitely a scam. A fairly common one too. I used to be a teller and we would see this all the time. The ATM is a big flag because you won't know it's a scam for at least two weeks when the check is done being checked out in the back office. If you go inside, any good teller would try to causally ask some questions about where the check came from and would flag it immediately for the back office to look at within the next 24 hours. "
1246,"A podcast I listen to had an FBI agent call in and explain this scam, as one of the hosts who was looking for a job brought this up as pretty shady.

1247,"I've run into a similar scam, but it was for when I was advertising for a subletter for my apartment. Thankfully I didn't go through with it, but it took me longer to understand what was happening than I'd like to admit.

Some red flags to look out for:  
1. Poor grammar. A lot of these emails are sloppy in sentence structure/don't capitalize things.  
2. If they are responding to a post you put up, they tend to ask questions that are already in the post.  
3. They send cheques that aren't in their name (mine told me her financier was sending me the cheque, which was super sketchy).  
4. They use language to make you rush through the process. My scammer said things like ""due to limited time"", your own scammer threatened your girlfriend with agents finding her (what the fuck?).  
5. When they send (or claim to send) the cheque, they may then claim to have ""accidentally"" sent you more than the agreed upon amount. They will then ask you to wire transfer the excess to some random account. This way, when the cheque is found out to have been a fraud and is withdrawn, they will also have received more money from you. My scammer sent me a USPS tracking number, but I never even got a cheque, but they asked me to wire transfer the extra amount before I even received it.  

Either way, it's great that you went with your gut and at least asked other opinions so you didn't fall for this bullshit.

1248,"As a German Redditor I find it fascinating that checks still seem to play such a dominant role in your finance system. If you want to apply for a job here you almost always have to give your bank account information. No serious line of work pays their employees with checks. Everything is handled through your bank account. From your salary or welfare or pension, to all your regular expenses like insurances, rent, downpayments...up to tax returns. Checks are almost non-existent. The thing about bank transfer is: once you transfer money to a different account, it is almost impossible to get it back. A scam like op witnessed wouldn't work that way.
On the other hand, if someone withdraws money from your account (your provider draws the monthly fee for your mobile phone for example) you actually can revoke these. But you have to give a good reason for that of course."

1250,"Glad you caught this one before any damage was done. A good rule of thumb to apply is that no legitimate business will ever ask an employee to use their personal bank accounts to do anything business related. Real businesses are subject to tax audit and must transact all business using their own accounts registered under the corporation or owner names. Even if you work for what seems like a legit business, and they are paying you, as soon as they ask you to use a personal account for something other than direct deposit of a paycheck, travel expense reimbursement, or bonus that is a major red flag that some type of fraud is underway."
1251,"Regarding the letter...

1252,"Something similar happened to me in 2008.

I was selling an old VW online for $3000. I got a check in the mail for $4000 and a call from a text translator (someone typed to her, she read to me and typed my response back to them) saying they wanted to buy and ship my car to some foreign country and that they would contact me with the shipping company.

I told her I didn't want to sell to them and I was going to shred the check, but really called the bank to verify the account. A day or two later they said they needed the money back because of some hardship and that I needed to send them a new check for the same amount back to them. I told her that I never cashed the check so they should still have the money and the conversation ended very quickly.

We called our local FBI branch and let them know. They are always on top of scams like this. The scam is the same, but the premise keeps changing. Send you a check for a large sum, then get you to send that money back to them (or elsewhere) before the check bounces and leave you with the debt and themselves $4k richer."

If you feel like baiting the scammer a bit, you could easily fake up a deposit slip and send that instead of actually making the deposit. In your original story, you said that your girlfriend was to use the money to buy supplies. Fake up some receipts to send back suggesting that she spent a large part of the check. They should then request a refund of the balance.    
If she had been following the senders instructions, she would then be out the money she ""spent"" on supplies plus the money she would be refunding. From here, you/she could fake up additional receipts ""spending"" the rest but it isn't necessary. Just tell them ""the check is in the mail"" and keep them hanging. "
1254,"This is the biggest scam around. She will buy supplies, they'll send another check (or the first check will be more than promised) to payout another person. 

A few days later the original check(s) bounce "
1255,A scam and a pretty bad one.  
1256,I had something similar happen to me 3 years ago when I was looking to sublease my apartment. A person from Hawaii sent me a check to pay for the sublease fee and to open a storage room for her belongings. My parents caught on that it was fake so I just shredded the check. Just a few months ago I got a call from some government employee or something asking about the details and nature of the scam.
1257,"That's a lot of money for supplies, glad you found out it was a scam.

A few years ago I had a summer job as a physiotherapist aide in a clinic and needed to wear scrubs. I asked my boss in the interview where she would recommend I get some scrubs, and she gave me a cheque for 150 to pick some up, and the directions ""you have until Monday"" (interview was on Wednesday).  She encouraged me to take the cheque into the bank to deposit it "
1258,"The terrible English in thst email would be enough to tell me that was a scam. So quick story time for those who read all the comments. 

I used to work front lines at a bank as a personal banker. A low lines peasant. I wasn't there for the transaction, jist the aftermath. But a guy comes in and asks why his account is overdrawn nearly 7k. That's negative 7k. This man is about 65, retired but not much to show for 50years or working. Just social security and a small pension at his monthly disposal. This was a very meddle class blue collar area for some perspective. 

We go through his transactions and find the check deposit. I ask him what it was from. He says he got a check in the mail after an email advised him that with his help, he could make some money. An attractive offer for a guy living month to month on two deposits. It was a 10k check thst came with the directions that if he cashed it and then sent x amount of money back to a recipient in the form of prepaid debit cards, he would be able to keep the rest. 

The teller line should have caught it. But they didn't. It's a tellers responsibility to catch shit like that. They literally go through training to protect the consumers. Either way. Check gets cleared and initial funds are released on the first day. Say 100 bucks. The rest clears the next day based on the assumption the check is good and based on the customers long standing relationship with the bank. 

5 days later is bounces after it clears the system on both ends. We find out and debit his account the full 10k. At this point he had taken out 8k worth of prepaid debit cards bought a new TV and some other things that he'd never been. Able to afford. 

Now hes negative thousands of dollars and in tears at my desk. It's hard to tell an old man that there isn't much we can do. There is a protocol at most banks, but the extent of the funds was just too great. Never really followed up, but just sucks to see people get fucked by what seem like such obvious scams to millennials, but life changing opportunities to our older generations. "
1259,You can tell it's a scam because they asked you to send your bank info back as confirmation. A real company would provide the supplies themselves or pay for it directly or reimburse you. No company should be giving you cash directly other than for the purpose of getting paid.
1260,"This literally happened to a friend of mine.  He was offered a job driving some rish guys mom to her doctors appointments and whatnot while he was working on new york.  Sent him a check 2500 and told him to send a money order somewhere so a ""company"" car can be shipped to him.   Now, despite EVERYONE telling him it's a scam, he did it anyway.   A few days after he sent the money, the old woman ""died"" and services were not longer nessisary. He thinks ""no big deal, made a couple hundred bucks ""    couple weeks later the bank tells him it was fraud and now he's fucked.   Somehow he manages to think this isn't hos fault at all.  "
1261,"It is so silly using a check these days. I've been having a lot of improvements done on my house in the last few months so I've been handing out a lot of checks. A lot of small companies aren't set up to take electronic payments, it's silly but it's just not worth the transaction fees to the companies I guess. "
1262,"A number of reasons, depending on method used. Most people I talk to fear electronic transfers and feel checks are more secure. Others do not like credit cards because it symbolizes debt. Debit cards are a high risk factor and educated American's shouldn't be using them for day-to-day activities given how laws work for reclaiming your money in case of fraud. Services that cost money are a big turn off for most Americans. Also large segments of the population do not like big brother, which electronic money transfers symbolize. Hell people still bury money instead of banking in some areas. List goes on. ;)"
1263,"A lot of US workers don't have typical bank accounts, or don't use them for various reasons. Usually poorer, lower class workers you have defaulted on their bank accounts, mind you. Going to cash the check in and handling the cash is how they do things.

People in the US are also suspicious of handing out Bank information for these exact reasons."
1264,"> A good rule of thumb to apply is that no legitimate business will ever ask an employee to use their personal bank accounts to do anything business related

I think I understand what you're trying to say, but your wording isn't quite right since it's not unusual for companies to reimburse employees for mileage and travel expenses afterwards."
1265,"A LOT of banking systems/practices are antiquated and no one wants to update them for fear of breaking things which currently work, or losing compatibility with other banks (particularly difficult to maintain when those banks operate in other countries and languages).

For this reason banks are just phasing out cheques entirely in favour of electronic methods because cheques are vulnerable to fraud and cost money to print. This is easier and safer for them than trying to make cheques more secure."
1266,"A credit card, maybe

Go buy it yourself and get reimbursed, sure.

Here's a check, cash it and keep a little for yourself: 100% scam. Real companies do not do that."
1267,"A company that pays expenses like this would have a much more stringent interview process. The real tell here is the request for an image of the deposit slip. I don't think most people on here understand that the deposit slip contains all of you account info, including account number and routing number. This scammer wants to inflate her account and then use that info to drain it. "
1268,"Especially within one day of ""hiring"" someone remotely they have never met or talked to on the phone.

A business is not going to trust someone with a 4k check they chatted with online for a few minutes."
1269," Not only that, but the letter says that they need to scan their deposit slip so that the ""employer"" can allow the check to process. That's not a thing. Especially in a MONEY ORDER. A money order is prepaid. So they don't need to make sure anything clears if it's a legit money order. 

This part of the scam seems predicated on the scamee not knowing how checking/money orders work. "
1270,"Well to be fair. Checking depends on trust as much as currency in general depends on blind faith. A check is just an imaginary layer on top of another imaginary layer. The whole economy works because of currency. The only thing holding it together is the glue, aka imagination, that holds this web of revolving debts and credits together. "
1271,"A teller can refuse a clearly counterfeit check, but a lot of these cashier checks are very convincing or aren't necessarily fake. We can usually call the institution to verify the check, but this can usually be pretty time consuming so it's not a tellers go to solution. Also, we don't typically ask why a member is depositing a check, but if something seems strange we might to try and figure out if the member has fallen for a scam. There is also mobile deposits and ATM deposits which make it more difficult to prevent fraudulent checks from being negotiated. Lastly, there are occasions where the check appears to be a real check for a intents and purposes, but we see the red flags and warn the member that this sounds like a scam. It is ultimately up to them and if the check is returned (due to a stop or NSF) they are on the hook for the money."
1272,"THIS.  I had a check owed to me go missing.  The company stopped payment on it, sent me another.  The old one turned up sometime later.  I marked it void to be sure, but that is it.

A check is just an order to a bank that X account will pay Y account amount A.  They don't really have to have anything other than that info, bank account info, routing info etc.  

I know you used to, and probably still could, just write that info out on a piece of paper and itd be a check.  It would probably still work today, just take a while to clear.  Paychecks and checkbooks are just formal, convenient ways to do this.

So yeah, if you have a check that isnt deposited, its meaningless to the other end.  And rather than hassle you-they would just stop payment on the check.  You can dp this too, if you ever get scammed of a check.  You dont want to do it often, but they'll do it."

1275,"A currency controlled by a nation state, I.e. fiat, is awesome for the country as long as the debts for that country are also in that currency.  Let’s take for example the US dollar and the pandemic. A majority of US debt is owned by us citizens, also China has a lot of our debt. By printing money, creating inflation, the debt becomes worth less. Seems like a sweet deal for the US government.

But who pays the most? Poor people wages will not rise at the rate of inflation and they have no exposure to the inflation in equities. Maybe they get 15/hr eventually but by the time that happens $15 is worth $7.50 in prepandemic prices.

Basically what I’m saying is inflation is a tool used buy the rich to get richer and keep the majority in financial slavery."
1276,"When I was younger we had a family friend who was a branch manager at Bank of America. When I was in college, he gave me the following advice:

""Don't open an account at B of A. They don't care about you unless you're rich."""
1277,"A few years back I left Fifth Third because they were going to charge me $8 a month (along with everyone else who didn't have $1500 in all their accounts) for the pleasure of banking with them.  I opened my first account with them when they were still Indiana Federal back in 1991.  I went in one day to ask some questions about the changed over & the lady behind the desk went ahead & changed my account ""for you convenience.""  I walked down the street to a local bank that bills itself as ""not for sale,""  went back to 5/3 & closed my account.  When I was asked what brought me in to open a new account & I told her she said that all branches were surprisingly busy because of that.  5/3 even had to shut down commenting on their Facebook page because of this."
1278,"I've been a business analyst for several credit card companies and banks. There are only 3 reasons someone will get charged a fee. 


1) They are seeing if you are too lazy to contest it (Like a late fee for paying 1 day late).


2) You have poor credit, so they are trying to get a few fees out of you before you eventually default. (Secured credit card with low limit and annual fees).


3) They don't want your business. 


If you are getting charged ""account maintenance"" fees, you fall into the 3rd bucket. People who don't have a lot of money are bad to do business with. Not only can a bank make practically no money off of a $500 checking account, but people with less money are the ones who take up the most time at the branches / on the phone. If you have $10K+ in your bank account, you probably don't care if your paycheck posts on Thursday or Friday, but someone with $20 to their name does, and they will go into the branch and suck up 2-3 hours of time from the employees. It's not personal. The bank is losing money on people who don't have money. They are just trying to shoo them out with petty fees. 

I will say, this is poor practice to do to recent college graduates. A few of the companies I worked for did a great job of ""graduating"" our products for people who graduated from college. The whole reason there are banking products geared towards college students is because you want them to remain customers after they graduate. You don't want to piss someone off right before they start making decent money. 


On a final note, if you have good credit, direct deposit, a few loans, credit cards, etc. with a bank, they will NEVER assess a late fee and refuse to revoke it. "
1279,"BOA does all kinds of shady things. 
I once went in to open a savings account (already had a checking account). Everything went as planned opened the account signed some stuff and left with my paperwork. 

Week later I get a credit card in the mail from BOA. I never applied for a credit card so I thought I had my identity stolen. Went to the bank to cancel and found out the young lady who opened my savings account apparently also applied me for a credit card. I never answered any income or verification questions, never signed anything for a credit card, or even expressed a wish to get a credit card. She asked and I said no. I don't even know how she got my social or applied without my signature. The only paper I signed was for a savings account as I read before I signed. 

Manager tried to talk me into keeping the card since I was a student to build my credit and all. The interest rate was terrible and it had a yearly fee so I declined and he canceled the card. A day later the woman who I opened my savings account with called me apologizing excessively...I figured she was trying to meet her quota of credit card applications for customers.... exactly what Wells Fargo got into trouble for...

Tldr: opened a savings account at BOA, they applied and opened a credit card in my name without my permission or knowledge. BOA is Satan..."
1280,"A tip for Schwab account holders: my favorite thing about the no fee/no min accounts is that I can have one high-balance account for bill pay and another low-balance account for ATM withdrawals. So if my debit card's ever skimmed, the possible loss is minimal. Under regular circumstances I never use the debit card for my high-balance account."
1281,"The fact that they're everywhere is exactly why people use them. A BofA member can go to just about any city in the US and find a branch. If you don't really know about your other options, that's a pretty reasonable one. "
1282,AFAIK BoA is primarily catering to a market that doesn't have to worry about $144 a year checking account fee.  A clientele who won't even notice it.  They're not evil.
1283,"B o A is the devil of big banks, Chase blows away B o A in every way. Just because it has America in the name, doesn't mean it is a wholesome American business. B o A preys on the poor and  misinformed.  "
1284,"No fee checking accounts were essentially killed by the Dodd-Frank act.  

In general, a checking account costs a bank with branches (like a BOA or Chase) about $300 per customer.  That's fees to Visa or Mastercard, ATMs, branches, salaries, etc.  

They make some of that back by charging interchange or per transaction fees to acquiring banks and providers for debit or credit card transactions.   The rest comes from fees.  

The fees were added back after about a decade of missing in action because of three rule changes:

1.  Banks could not charge late fees as easily as they did before for credit card accounts, having to offer grace periods, and curbing the practice of ""trailing interest"".  They also changed the formula that banks had to use to calculate the minimum amount due, so it would be higher (and eventually save customers interest charges).

2.  Banks used to be able to allow customers to overdraft, and charge a fee, if a debit transaction caused a negative balance.  The government reclassified this as a form of credit (basically), and required opt-in for this service.   Without the opt-in, a bank can't charge a fee allowing an account to overdraft.  This ended the ""I bought a cup of coffee and it cost me $39.50"" complaints, but also has led to a big spike in declined at the point-of-sale transactions.  

3.  Between the Patriot Act, Dodd-Frank, Sarbanes-Oxley, and Grahm-Leach, banks compliance costs skyrocketed starting in 2002, especially after the financial melt-down in 2007/2008. Even customers with uncomplicated accounts (like checking and savings only) got caught up in a lot of new reporting, verification, and related measures.  In the past low-value accounts just didn't get type of scrutiny.  

All of these changes, which smaller banks and credit unions are exempt from, have pluses and minuses for consumers.  A good argument for them is that they are more upfront - you know what the charges are and what risks you are assuming instead of being ""tricked"" with claims of ""free checking (with high fees in small print)"".  But on the other hand, saavy but low-income people before had the ability to bank with a large institution and avoid fees.   They still do, but the requirements a little bit harder to meet than they were before, excluding people who really need free banking the most (i.e. the lowest wage people, the people with mostly cash incomes, etc).   It's a little bit of unintended consequences since the number of people who now rely on non-bank financial services firms has increased year over year.  Additionally you have services that provide checking account like services for low fees like AMEX Serve for example, that seem to just replace banks for the most straightforward situations."
1285,Merrill Lynch being owned by them has made my life so easy. I log into either my Merrill account or my B of A account and I can see everything all in one place and I have no fees and better rewards and interest rates.

1287,I've been with navy federal credit union for 9 years and never looked back. Never even sniffed at other banks. Been happy and never had an issue. A couple times there were fraudulent transactions on my cc but navy federal took care of it hassle free. 
1288,This is what I don't understand. If you can't avoid the fees then don't use that bank. I have B of A and have never been assessed a fee because I read the fee schedule and found I could avoid all of them. 
1289,Look at that.  A logical person who understands what they're signing up for and how the services work.  If only there were more of us.
1290,"A couple years ago I got my debit card skimmed.  My CU noticed it about 15 minutes before I did.  I called them and they'd already killed the existing card.  I walked into the nearest branch on my lunch hour that same day and they had my new card waiting for me.  Had they mailed the new card, it could have been two or three days before I received it."
1291,"really should have just closed the account immediately. You'd be in debt the initial 35 which you would have to pay eventually, but it wouldn't be an issue until they sent you to collections for it (which would take forever). So by the time you got your next paycheck, you just reopen the account, pay the 35, and you're A-ok."
1292,"Grew our emergency budget to about 3k, we hit our goal after months of saving.

1294,"A lot of people mistakenly believe that a credit card is there for emergencies.

I mean.... *yes* it can be, but only if you are getting 0% interest and could theoretically pay it off at any time with cash.  Otherwise, it's not there for an emergency, it's there to rip you off. "

1296,">Any car you're not paying $400/month on is going to need an $1800 repair just about every year.

I would argue that number a little bit.  The rule of thumb my father gave me is the rolling Kelly blue book value.

If the costs to repair a car is going to exceed the value of the car in any given 12 month period, then it's no longer worth it to repair the car.

So for example, the 1997 Honda Accord my husband is currently attempting to drive into the ground has so far not exceeded more than $800 in maintenance for any given year.  Part of that is having a mechanic who knows those cars inside and out and can catch a possible future problem before it becomes a definite today problem, and fix it up while it's still cheap.  Part of it is the extremely low cost of parts for that particular car (although Honda has now stopped making OEM parts for it, I've since learned.)  For many years it was a $45 oil change every six months and ""come back if it makes a funny noise.""

All that said, $100/month into the car budget isn't a bad idea.  Just that some cars are going to be a heck of a lot cheaper over their lifespan than others.

(But if you're a car nut, then you're probably not driving ancient Accords.  That thing is a box on wheels in which the fanciest components are an automatic transmission and the aftermarket radio.  It's clean, and it goes from A to B, and someday it will finally die, but until then, no need to fuss over it.)"

Later if you do something with that crypto and send it from your wallet to a different address, the ledger will move some of your crypto to a different wallet, minus fees for using the network. 

The idea of that a hardware wallet is safer because your need to have the physical object or your secret super long list of words in order to initiate a transfer, as opposed to say coinbase where bad actors only need to compromise your phone/exchange account. 


If I'm talking down to you I'm really not meaning to."
1301,"No they don't. A number of very shady or illegal tactics are available to them if they don't back up their positions by something and they have hedging problems.

Like saying ""oops, we've been hacked!""
With crypto, it's very hard to prove that they are lying if they have a certain level of expertise.

Or if they have partial hedging, they can temporarily close accounts because of ""suspicious activity"" and use those funds to cover other withdrawals. By the time the users manage to unblock their accounts, they can block other accounts and so on. While your user base grows you can do this indefinitely.

You can get away with stuff like this for decades, during which time you prepare an exit scam. Fraud and embezzlement are NOT theoretical concepts, they happen in real life all the time. Some go to prison, some don't and we may never know what really happened.

This is exactly the reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place, so you have a way of operating with money online without risk of third party error and fraud."
1302,Yeah seems like it’s extreme fuckery that should be totally illegal right? That’s what half a century of financial deregulation gets us. A literal fictional economy that is identical to gambling
1303,"This is fantastic advice as I experienced the old fashioned greed while I was still in highschool where my stepfather stole $1,800 I had saved to go to Europe with friends. He told my mother that I had spent it all on frivolous things even though I was saving for over two years for this trip. A week and half later he had a $2,200 set of brand new golf irons. Got a new account the day I turned 18.

Edit: was working for minimum wage the entire time"
1304,"I used a joint bank account after completing my undergraduate degree. 

When I moved back home, rather than pay rent to my parents,  they had the ability to withdraw money from that account and use it towards the parent plus loan.  I could see their withdraws, my credit card payments, and my deposits.  Everything appeared normal.  

The co-signer of the parent plus loan received a letter one day notifying them that the loans had been placed into forbearance.  They reached out to me and asked if I knew anything. I had no idea and told them that.  Over the next several weeks, money was being withdrawn from the joint account to pay for the parent’s everyday expenses (meals, groceries, etc).  

After discussing the issue with them, one of them admitted to withdrawing the money, not using it for the student loans, and spending it on “romantic relationships” outside of their marriage. 

I don’t talk to the one that took my money any more.  It’s a weird feeling when you find out the person you thought you were helping turns around and hurts you. They had the opportunity to reduce their student loan debt by $60,000 (roughly) and instead used it for their own desires.  A separate bank account could have definitely improved my situation. Get it.  

I got the money back from them eventually (401k withdraw).  It could have been worse.  But ya, get a separate bank account.  Families suck."
1305,"A couple weeks after I turned 18, my dad brought me the paperwork and said to fill it out and take it to the bank. He was worried that my mom would catch wind of the money I would start earning and try to claim it.

Sometimes parents do this stuff for you, I guess."
1306,"Listen to OP's advice. I only had a joint account when I went to college so that my mom could deposit money and help support me. By sophomore year money stopped going in and would only come out (without asking). ""Oh, dad and I had to borrow $400 until his check comes in,"" ""We took out $500, we'll put back $550 at the end of the month, I promise."" A lifetime of trust issues could have been avoided if I hadn't been so naive at 18."
1307,I'm a banker. A kid came in one day and asked what happened to the 16k he had in his account. I looked and the IRS took it all because his mother was o. the account as the primary owner and she had a tax lien. He literally almost collapsed because there was nothing we could do to help him. They froze all of the assets she was listed as an owner on and took seized them. He said it ruined him. All I could do was tell him what he should have done when he turned old enough to get his own account. Dont know what happened to him but it's also not the first time I've seen this.
1308,"I’ll do you one as well, my *actual* dad cleared out my 300 bucks of saving I had at 12 or 13 and took my Christmas money(easily around 500 or so in total) to pay bills and promised me he’d pay it back. Still waiting on that. Every time I would bring it up he’d get all teary eyed and say how bad it made him feel that he had to borrow from his jobless teenage kid and to stop bring it up. 

This is also the man that 

A) wanted to kick me out of my GRANDPARENTS house at 16 and have me get a place of my own and a job(I did get a job at 17 because I had/wanted to start paying for my own things)

B) when my grandmother finally had enough of his shit and went off on him he said that “I did pay you back because I’ve bought you food and clothes when you stay with me on the weekend” you know, his legal obligation as a parent. 

C) was a dead beat that never payed child support to my grandparents for taking care of me even though the agreement was literally under the table payments so the didn’t drag his ass to court 


D) and for the double whammy of shitty parent lottery my mother never saved for my college like she was supposed to after the divorce and I basically lost out on 20 grand that would have payed like 75% of the loans I have currently and constantly begged me to borrow money(learned my lesson with dear old dad).

At least I could trust my grandparents with their name on my checking account and my taxes. there were a couple times gram wanted to see the statements because she didn’t like some things(I think it was over MTG cards and I wasn’t even spending that much on them) I was spending my money on by I basically told her to fuck off she wasn’t the one working and putting money into it and my decision was accepted and she never asked again. Still got my own account when I moved out though after college."
1309,"A large, fee-free, online institution like Ally is good. You can wire money for free with Zelle and she can ATMs anywhere and get fees reimbursed. Depositing cash is the only issue, but she could send you cash, have you deposit it then Zelle her the money. 

Or she could get Alliant, a credit union very similar to Ally - No Zelle, but offers even more ATMs, including some with cash deposit. Alliant also offers very robust credit cards to their members, which could be hugely beneficial to her building credit going forward."
1310,"First day of university, banks were all over the quad getting freshmen to sign up for credit cards and kids were wild over it signing up in exchange for half a jimmy johns sub or lanyard.

Worst part was it was the credit union that was doing it. A place which I had assumed had our best interests in mind over profit"
1311,Worth pointing out: the adult doesn’t have to be a parent. A minor can open a bank account with ANY trusted adult.
1312,"A bit different here, it was 14, but you had to have a parent it jsut sign of on a document  saying something akin to: i give consent for my child to create an account at this bank. That ws it they have no further control even if htey demand somehting they are not given a dime of info."
1313,A lot of other banks have mobile deposits. Charles Schwab or some other ones even offer free atm
1314,"A little late to the party but i had this same thing happen to me. Someone had gotten into my ebay account and purchased $300 worth of Supreme t-shirts. Thankfully i have the paypal and ebay apps installed on my phone so i got the notifications about the purchases without needing to dig through hundreds of spam emails. Got everything sorted out pretty quickly, got my refunds and set up 2 factor authentication everywhere i could. 

&#x200B;

I have to say though, having those app notifications really saved my ass."
1315,"This exact same thing happened to me three days ago. Started getting a ton of emails, going to ""promotions"" inbox, spam inbox, and my regular inbox. I was annoyed, but I didn't think much of it. You don't need any passwords to sign my email up for spam.

The next evening, I got an email from my bank. A total stranger was added to my account for member to member transfers. Obviously an immediate huge red flag. 

I called and let them know I had no idea who this person was. The woman from the bank said they tried to transfer some money but the bank flagged it and stopped them. They got me over to fraud protection so we could sort it out.

Well, maybe the bank DID stop a transaction, but not until the fraudster transferred about $3000 out of one of my savings accounts.

Somehow they got into my online banking, no idea how. If my inbox wasn't so compartmentalized, I might not have noticed the email from the bank because I was so inundated with spam."
1316,"Can companies do this to you? A couple months ago I got a call from Nissan trying to sell me on an extended warranty for my car. I think it was legit because I had to go through a few people and they had the hold music and it would occasionally say the dealership name. After talking to the actual salesman I decided I did not want to pay for something I would probably never use, or something I could just pay out of pocket for. The salesman became more and more agitated and would not take no for an answer. After saying no after the 10th time, i went ahead and hung up. I thought that was the end of it, but the next day I got like 7 missed calls from various area codes and Idk what for I did not want to answer them. And I've been getting regular calls like these since. Now I'm wondering if that salesman angrily put me on some type of call list."
1317,"If you're worried about something like this there's a _dead simple_ way to curb the risks;

https://privacy.com/

Create a new virtual card for each amazon.com purchase you make, ensure you enable ""single transaction"" in the Privacy app. After that transaction the credit card __cannot__ be used again.

A pain in the ass but truly ensures that you're protected from breaches."
1318,"A handy approach I use is I bought a Google domain for $12/year and it comes with a free mail server that allows wildcard addresses.  Every site I sign up with i use website/business-name@mydomain.com, and they all get delivered to the mailbox of my choice, where I can filter them on which address it was sent to.  This lets me easily see which login was compromised if I start getting lots of spam, and easily filter them out to see the legitimate emails.  If I started getting spam on my main email address, which I don't use anywhere, or one of my financial logins, I would know something serious was up."
1319,"Something similar happened to my coworker a couple months ago. His personal email blew up with all kinds of spam to hide a couple order confirmation emails from Best Buy. The scammer ordered about a dozen laptops and they were to be shipped (1 did) to an address just down the block from my coworker's apartment. A call to his bank, Best Buy, and UPS (to attempt to intercept the one that shipped) and things got worked out in a matter of a few hours. This happened while we were at work and that certainly gave him a bit of a scare, and detailed his afternoon."
1320,"I had something similar happen to me recently. I have my credit card set to send me a notification on any transaction $0.00 or more. I received a notification for $800 at Best Buy online, then received almost a thousand emails - most thanking me for subscribing to their newsletter in various languages. A few minutes later I received a 2FA alert from my email, which I denied. I called my bank, canceled my credit card, then sifted through my emails and found one from Best Buy. I changed my password, called them, and got them to cancel the order and refund it. The order (which was archived) was listed as in-store pickup for a gaming PC, and I asked them to have local law enforcement there for the scheduled pickup, but I don't think they did.

Truth is this is not going to stop. As long as companies continue to use lax data security and treat user info like it isn't important, we are going to have to put up with this. There have been so many big data breaches - including EquiFax - that we all need to just assume nothing is private anymore (which is both sad and infuriating)."
1321,"That works, until you get a stupid website that thinks they can do a regex validation of email more complex than `.*@.*`^(1) and they break because they refuse to accept a '+' in an email despite it being a legitimate email character.  A better solution to this, though a little bit heavier-weight, is what Outlook.com does.  They allow you to create as many email aliases as you like, so you can create ""myaddress_amazon@outlook.com"" and it will be a valid email address, without the '+' that some sites hate, and without the obvious indicator that spammers can use to strip the filter address down to its base (as has already been said, they know what follows a '+' in email addresses these days is irrelevant).

^(1) Email validation^(2) has a long and sordid history.  In reality, it takes several very complex regular expressions to fully validate an email address, and nobody ever gets those right.  Even `.*@.*` is technically wrong because there's no requirement in the email RFC that says '@' must be present.  There are other allowable separators, though '@' is the common standard for decades and you'd have to go back to the days of CompuServe and Prodigy to find a non-@ email address.  But those old email addresses are still technically valid, and if you think you need to validate email addresses then you need to validate them correctly.  The only sure fire way to verify an email is correct is to contact its authoritative SMTP server and ask if it's a valid address.

^(2) Note that there's a differentiation here between ""Validating an email address is correct"" and ""Validating input data for malicious intent.""  You can filter out [Little Bobby Tables](https://xkcd.com/327/) without verifying that the email address is technically correct per the various email RFCs.  You absolutely should be sanitizing input and never directly running user input as code (this is why parameterized sql queries exist, for example; string replace/concatenation with user input is dangerous, and parameterization makes it not dangerous).  You shouldn't be validating email addresses are valid email addresses."
1322,"Edit: Thanks for the correction

Because SMS texts can be intercepted. 

It doesn't happen often, but it does happen if the hackers are super savvy. A few people lost millions of dollars worth of bitcoins because they used ~~SMS 2FA (2 Factor Authentication via SMS)~~ sites that allowed their passwords to be reset through SMS."
1323,"SMS is: 
A) interceptable if someone is close to your tower and has the right equipment.
B) Portable if someone knows some basic trivial information about you and is good at social engineering. They will call your carrier and ask to port your number to their cell phone, allowing them to get all your 2FA numbers.  See https://www.social-engineer.com/your-phones-betrayal/ .  Many carriers' security practices are EXTREMELY lax in this regard."
1324,"A lot, but some criminals will order a new SIM card by impersonating you on the phone with your carrier and intercept the message."
1325,"Do you know how many packages that require signature get a scribble and a fake name? I used to send out new hire kits that included a security key fob so we required a signature. About a third of the time I checked for delivery, the signature was a scribble and the name was A.Smith or something equally unhelpful and unknown. Or the signature was clearly John Smith but the driver put the addressee's name (say, Alexander Bonaparte Custer) to say who received the package.  

Good delivery drivers make sure it gets to the right person. There aren't that many who remain good after a holiday season."
1326,"A popular way is to impersonate the target and go into a physical store where there isn't as much of a paper trail. Confirm a few details (""oh I lost my phone and got this unlocked one, can you give me a SIM?""), walk out with SIM.

Cameras? Eh, it was probably a mule and not the actual fraudster who did it (a scam on its own, even) or the store itself has non-working cameras because reasons. By the time you catch on this happened and alert your carrier the damage is done and you're spending dozens of hours fixing your life."
1327,"Here we have another posting that assumes everyone is under 40.  

I am 60 and I retired late last year.  I cut from 80% equities to 40% equities over the last 5 years. A year ago I was questioning myself.  Now I am remembering why I made that decision and stuck to it.  

The real point is I, and lots of folks, did need to be looking at the value.  IT DOES affect my long term game.  Having to withdraw from a suddenly significantly reduced total value near the beginning of retirement is a bad situation."
1328,"The risk is that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  A 19% drop over the course of two and a half weeks could be a non-event like the mini-crash at the end of 2018 if things turn around quickly.  

Alternatively, this could be just the start of significant losses rivaling the 2008 recession in scope and scale. It's definitely possible to imagine a scenario where people would be glad to *only* be down 19% now rather than down 50% a few months from now.  

It's too early to tell which reality will play out.  Personally, I think the supply issues caused by this will be absolutely massive, so I'm betting that things will get worse before they get better.  I could be wrong, but I'm feeling pretty good about my decision to sell stocks a couple weeks ago locking in gains."
1329,"Pretty much never. 401k's are heavily protected against law suites, bankruptcies and other malicious activitities. Its heavily advised to not pull from a 401k until either retirement comes or you are experiencing a life-changing event. A market correction is not 'life-changing' because the investor should've been aware that this shit happens in a cyclical period. If your older, you should've been invested in bonds rather than stocks since they are safer than stocks (and income is more stable, generally speaking)"
1330,"A financial advisor (which I’m not) may tell you that a healthy 401k would have the equivalent of your salary at 30

A realist will tell you that it’s whatever you can afford. Some people have loans. Some people have low paying jobs. Some people have kids. Some people have medical expenses. 

So just do your best to save what you can. I will add though that due to compounding interest saving early is huge in helping you retire at the age you want."
1331,Haha...I just started trading options a few weeks ago.  I've been reading over A LOT of charts and every chart I've looked at covering the last year or two has absolutely SCREAMED bubble!!!
1332,"That alone puts you way above the average person. I just turned 26 and have absolutely nothing invested in stocks, no 401k, no retirement plan, I don't even have a set career right now. I wish I was alone in that regard, but I have lots of friends and acquaintances in the same situation. 

Just trying to be encouraging I guess, it seems like you have yourself set up better than the majority of the country - assuming you're in the US. A lot of us are struggling just to keep a roof over our heads. You may not like where you are but I'd be proud of myself if I were in your shoes."
1333,"Renovations as well.  I had to explain this to my fiancee.  She wants all of these projects down now, but it just isn't feasible time wise or monetarily.  A house is an ever evolving thing, there is always something to improve."
1334,"This is such a good point. A lot of my friends moved out of home into their first rentals and had to buy nice furniture, electronics, white goods straight away, getting themselves into debt. Then there's my husband and I on our mismatched hand-me-down couches, hard rubbish bookshelves and eBay whitegoods. The cats scratch up couches anyway. "
1335,"As a side note to this, I want to stress the importance of a quality couch. Certain furniture items the dirt cheap versions will serve you fine. Not so much with couches. When I was first starting out my fiancee and I bought a cheap sectional couch at Value City furniture for $750. It looked nice enough and was comfortable, but the stupid thing fell apart in less than a year. By two years it holes all over it, was covered in dog fur and the frame had actually broken in one spot and the whole thing sunk lower at one spot. So eventually we get so sick of the couch we decide to go buy another one, which I'm not too thrilled about since I think it might just end up like the first. This time we went to a halfway decent furniture store and spent $3500 for a leather couch, large chair and ottoman. Good Lord this couch is so much better. A big problem with the old couch was it couldn't handle our dog. He thinks he's a cat and loves to climb on top of furniture and perch. The new couch both shows zero scratch marks from him and it repels his fur since it's leather. Good leather is very durable. I have friends who complain their dogs scratched up their leather, but ours shows zero wear after four years with it. When I sit on other leather couches now I notice their leather is usually much thinner feeling than ours. Whatever it is it's working. Like I said it's been with us four years and has gone through an interstate move and still looks as good as the day it was delivered. I'm confident we'll have it for another 10 or 20 years, which is much cheaper than the $750 one than lasted two years on a per year basis and it just looks nicer overall. It's also more comfortable, especially the chair with the ottoman. You just sink into the thing.

Now this just couches. Some stuff the cheap stuff is at least good enough until you can get something better. For example, I have a coffee table I got at Wal Mart for $15 (Mainstays Parson's table) that's still going strong ten years later. Sure, it looks and particularly feels cheap (it's made of particle board and is very lightweight), but it functions perfectly fine as a coffee table and only shows any signs of wear on the edges. I bought it when I was in college and only got around to replacing it this Spring with a coffee table I built myself in a woodworking class I took, and even then we didn't throw it away because feel bad throwing away perfectly good furniture. It's now used as an extra storage shelf next to our entertainer center."
1336,A little bit of handiness goes a long way too. Some of my nicest pieces of furniture are things that I found for free and then refurbished. 
1337,"Furnishing isn't my worry. I'm trying to figure out how so many people can afford these houses in the first place. I have to go over an hour away from where I work to get any house under $500k. The only listings under that near me are 1 bedroom condos.

Even in relatively cheap areas of the country $200k seems pretty average for a house, yet the average income is around $55k. A $200k house in a LCOL area is still over 3x the average national income."
1338,"My wife, as well as I, had nothing 4 years ago. Jail does that to people. HIT THE TRASH PILE. A number of things we have amassed from zero are nothing short of spectacular. She has become the girl you ask around town for specialty things. Within a few weeks she will track one down. Need a hot dog and bun toaster? Got one! Need a commercial 10' x 20' pop up tent, got that too... Fuckin hell she hits certain ""ritzier"" neighborhoods on monday nights and tuesday mornings before and as trash is running. We have literally stocked our new home office with shit others have thrown out. Our pediatrician, day care, and anyone involved with child care, in general, gets a visit from her once a month dropping toys, books, and any cleaning supplies that are still good. It is sickening what we waste as humans. That shit would've hit the dump never to be seen by us again."
1339,"Yes this. Very must this point in today's world, we all emerge into the world in fully furnished homes, from a different era. 

I'd like to also make a point here about today's furniture, and fixtures. They are mostly CRAP! Please do some research into the topic, and I mean spend a year on the topic or something ridiculous like that. Know that most furniture sold today is made of ""engineered wood"", so pretty much saw dust mixed with glue to for a kind of wood polymer, then covered with a veneer which is a millimeter thick layer of real wood. A sort of wooden wall paper for furniture. There are a lot of fabulous positives for this new world reality of furniture. Hard wood is heavy, and engineered wood is not heavy. It's inexpensive to manufacture, and much more repeatable. That's about it, to purchase real hard wood furnishing is expensive and requires a dedicated craftsman to make the thing you buy. So it's an investment, and it takes time to fully invest in fine furniture.

Buyer beware, the furniture industry sells engineered wood products as if they are fine hardwood furniture. That is to say they have at some point in the past discontinued the hardwood furniture, replaced with engineered wood furniture, but kept the same prices. That caused actual hardwood furniture to sky rocket in price as a differentiation, simple market economics there. "
1340,"Good point. I would add a bit of advice also: 1. If you don't like doing ""yard work, DON'T BUY A HOUSE WITH A YARD. You can destroy the resale value of your home and your neighbors' homes by letting the outside fall apart. Don't buy more home than you are willing and able to clean and maintain, inside and out."
1341,"If you're looking for high quality on a budget and you're fairly handy, building your own furniture is not as hard you might think, particularly if you keep the design simple and avoid curves. I had no prior woodworking experience and I recently built a coffee table using free plans I find online. If you check my post history there are pictures I posted on the woodwork sub. The materials cost a total of about $60, including all the wood, stain, screws, wood putty, polyurethane and sandpaper. The wood was just regular old pine I bought at Home Depot. If I were going to do this again I would probably spring for higher grade wood, not so much because the pine doesn't look nice (I picked boards with the best grain patterns and the stain really brought them out) but because some of the boards were warped which made getting everything flush at the end a lot of extra work. Also pine is very soft wood which means it's easy to work, but also easy to accidentally leave marks in. I picked the Ana White Tryde Coffee Table mainly because the design was simple and didn't require any special woodworking techniques or tools, but there are many other free plans out there. All you really need to build the one I did is some kind of saw and a drill. The ideal saw would be a table saw, but even just a $25 jig saw would work fine. You could even do it with a hand saw, but there's a lot of cutting involved and it would get pretty tiresome. A random orbit sander, a power hand planer, and counter sink drill bit would also be helpful but aren't 100% necessary. You can get the sander for $25 on Amazon. I think a planer is more like $50. The bit is just a few bucks. I only needed the planar because of the aforementioned warped boards. They were also not quite round at the corners which I used a bench planer to fix, but you wouldn't need to do that if you just bought better grade wood that was already square enough to build with."
1342,"Recently moved in with my partner from the city out to the country! We let our new neighbours in the building we live know we have very little furniture. A lot of them are old and ended up giving us a bunch of stuff. Those who didn't give us things told us about auctions to go to and the various reuse centres (basically free stores at dumps) and now we've furnished most of our apartment for about $40! 

If you're in the city, definitely try to go out to the country and find estate sales, auctions, and thrift stores. "
1343,"Function over form, especially when just starting out. I'm only a couple years out of college so i can attest to this. A chair is a chair, you sit on it. You wont spend hours admiring it in person, unlike people that do on esty, pinterest, and instagram."
1344,"Everyone touts Craigslist as the end-all, but if [Nextdoor](nextdoor.com) is a viable option for you, I'd highly suggest using it. A lot of people post classifieds and free stuff all the time. And you don't have to lug your brand-new find a country mile back home (unless...you actually live in the country). Additional plus; you can keep up with the general goings-on of your neighborhood via the posts and discussions. 

First, because there's a higher level of accountability: you have to use address verification to sign up and use it. 

Second, there is a sense of security through proximity: users only see other users/posts from their own neighborhood or nearby ones; combined with the fact that addresses have to be verified, there is less incentive to screw someone over/do shady stuff (this is not to say that people won't be shady or quesrionable, but rather that sites with this level of verification can reduce that).

Third: you get to know your neighbors. Or at least who's around. "
1345,"I wish more people realized this. I have a friend who got her first apartment after graduating college recently. She had pretty much every kitchen utensil you could ever want before she even moved and within the first week she was fully furnished with new furniture. 

A month ago her car broke down and she couldn't afford to fix it.
"
1346,"Another option if you're handy: build it. A lot of furniture is buildable, and you might even be able to make it look better than the pre-built ones. Also, you get that feeling of pride of having custom furniture. "
1347,"Agreed! Don't forget about places such as craigslist to find killer deals or even freebies. A few weeks ago, while I was browsing the free section on craigslist, I came across someone who was moving to another state. She said it would've cost her more to ship her furniture than to buy it all new. 

And this is how I was able to get a couch, love seat and matching nightstands for FREE. All were in great cosmetic condition, just a bit dirty."
1348,"My husband deals with bedbugs for a living, and they even get in wood furniture.. not just soft stuff. A lot of people assume because a house is really nice/expensive there's no way things they buy from them will have bedbugs. Not true at all.. he has many clients with multi million dollar homes and bedbugs. One of them has thrown out around 40k worth of furnishings and carpeting at this point because they can't get rid of them!! The house is too large for the usual methods to work. Not worth it. If I buy anything secondhand, he goes with me, inspects it, then heat treats it just to be sure before it ever comes in our house. Even books aren't safe. 

Thrift store warehouses are one of the worst places for bedbugs. "
1349,"This is so true and how I furnish our house. We are military and move fairly often. A lot of my peers think they are ""above"" getting used furniture... I mean if they want to pay thousands for cheaply made furniture then fine, but all my furniture is better quality from when furniture was made of solid wood, and I paid 20 to 50 bucks per piece. I love it and I definitely am one who likes the thrill of the hunt."

1354,"Craigslist story time.  A few years ago, my daughter was ready for a more grown up bedroom.   We sold her old set to a young couple with the cutest little girl.  When we were shopping for her new set we knew we wanted a solid wood set.  Found a dresser that was a classic style, 20 bucks. We went to pick it up, and the woman selling it was moving out of state.  She gave me about 30 tomato cages, suggested we give her old van a test drive.  Since the 2 kids we had were with a sitter, we agreed.  The van broke down on us, and we called her and told her we'd be a little later because we were going to mess with it and get it going. When we got back, she felt so bad. She said , "" well I'm guessing you don't want the van, huh.""  My husband joked and said ""I'll give ya 600 bucks for it.""  She agreed, we bought it and drove it home.   Sold my small car, and fixed the part on the van for 75.00. 3 months later, found out we were having twins.   A month after that, my husband lost his job he had had for 15 years.  That van and the woman who sold it to us kept us from falling into debt and losing a vehicle, not to mention we now had the space to accommodate 4 kids.  I'm sure there are horror stories from craigslist, but there are so many good stories too.  I'll never forget when we left her house she said to us ""we have had so many people help us out and I hope this becomes a blessing for your family.""  It most certainly was.  "

1357,"Sooo.... We were moving, and we had a festive night out before moving day. I passed out on the couch, and someone may have peed my pants. A lot. Still never found out who.    
    
Anyway, it was a nice couch, though cloth, and I didn't want to have it cleaned to move it. It was typhoon wet in the middle cushion and backing. So I put it on CL. I said my friends child slept on it and peed it up (The shame was too great). I said that on the ad, full disclosure. Although I didn't say it was full grown man-pee, pee was definitely involved. It needed to be cleaned.    
    
I listed it for a silly price (like $20 because I thought 'free' would take longer than crazy low price). The people that came 2 hours after I listed it asked about the pee area. The lady pointed to the pee ""zone"", then (*shutter*), pushed her spread hand into it until it did that weird wet phhhshhhuuuk moist compression noise. She raised her now moist hand and said ""Ain't that bad!"", then put said glistening hand in her purse and grabbed me $20. She never asked to use my sink. Loaded up the couch and off they went.    
    
I don't know how this is relevant. But that CL lady touched my pee."

1360,"One of my favorite jokes is along this theme. 

A married guy goes out with some of his old single buddies. He lacks the tolerance for alcohol that he once had, and he starts realizing that he's really drunk. His friends, glad to reconnect with him, continue to buy him shots.  He tries to turn them down but the peer pressure is too great so he keeps drinking until his stomach has had enough. He ends up vomiting on his shirt right there in the middle of the bar. His wife is rather up tight, and he starts to freak out about what she's going to say when he gets home. As his friends are loading him into a cab home, one of the friends tells him to relax, and asks him if he had a $10 bill. The drunk guy reluctantly reaches in his wallet and hands his friend $10.  The friend tucks the money in the drunk's shirt pocket and tells him to tell his wife that a drunk guy puked on him,  but not to worry because the guy felt so bad that he gave him 10 to get his shirt cleaned. Reassured, the guy gets on the cab and makes his way home. When he arrives his wife is visibly upset, demanding to know why he was out so late and why he smells like vomit. Confidently, the man relays the story about someone else puking on him, and tells his wife to reach in his shirt pocket for proof. His wife grabbed the money from his shirt, examined it, and then pointed out that there was actually $20 in his shirt pocket - to which the drunk husband replied: ""oh yeah well he also shit in my pants"".

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

1372,"I know this is probably going to get down votes, but for everyone who has been saying ""I don't get crypto"" over the years, THIS is why crypto exists.  It was created in response to the sketchy shit banks did during the mortgage crisis, and what we're seeing this week is just replaying all of that.  The hedge funds are clearly coordinating with brokers to protect their short position.  If you had the same short position, they'd have no problem taking you for all you're worth.  But if they short it - time to shut down buying to suppress the price.  Time to get the media to paint the retail investors as right wing extremists, or as fools who are going to hurt themselves when the opposite is true.  Time to make fake claims of closing out their short positions to instill fear.  Time to trade to each other after hours and during buying halts to make the price look like it's falling on very low volume restricted trading.  But what it's never time for them to do - own up to the fact that they used YOUR money to open extremely risky short positions to try make themselves rich.

Crypto has the power to end all of that.  A decentralized system means everybody plays by the same rules, and everybody can hold their own money if they want to.  No more giving your cash to banks to enable them to manipulate the system in their favor by bending or breaking the rules in ways that you can't.  I hope the one thing that people get out of this blatant abuse of the system is a realization that this isn't the first time it's happened, it won't be the last, and it's the exact reason cryptocurrencies exist."

1376,"I'm an Uber driver. I am part of a community of Uber/Lyft drivers that you can find over at UberPeople.net. Yes you are correct, there are many drivers who do NOT understand the true cost of driving for these companies.

Uber and Lyft have been advertising that drivers can make $30 or something per hour with them. That's bullshit. First of all, you can never guarantee that amount because earning money here relies on having passengers. You don't get paid by the hour. You get paid PER MILE and a little per minute. For example, here in LA/OC California, the rates in majority of the places are 60 CENTS PER MILE, 20 CENTS PER MINUTE for Uber (and it keeps getting lower each year). Lyft, from what I've heard from Lyft drivers, is just 30 CENTS PER MILE. Second, serious drivers have to take into consideration the cost of GAS. Here, it's over $4/gallon now!!! Let's say you need to put gas in your car every day and get it to full tank. You're gonna spend $30 to $40 a day at the current prices. Now let's say you start driving passengers around and for that day you made $100. Well guess what, you have to deduct $30 or $40 from that to see how much you probably really made (taxes, depreciation, and other costs not yet included!). So suddenly, you'll see you actually just made only around $60! If you drive Uber full time, you're pretty much guaranteed to have to go to the maintenance shop monthly at around $100 to $120 per visit, not counting the extra costs of whatever they find that you'll need to have fixed!

Tips, those are things you shouldn't be counting on as a driver because there is no guarantee you'll receive any. Besides, depending on your market, majority of your passengers might not tip no matter how great your service is or how clean and awesome your car is. 

Another thing that makes it hard to make money with Uber is the lack of information you receive as a driver, regarding the ride request you're receiving. All you really get is the location of where you're supposed to pick up your passenger and their name (whatever name they made up, it can be as ridiculous as Mickey Mouse). The destination will be revealed once you actually have the passenger in the car and you start the trip. Now most recently, Uber started giving us drivers ""ranks"". There are ""Pro"" drivers, ""Gold"" drivers, and ""Diamond"" drivers. Pro drivers are your standard drivers who have medium to low Acceptance Ratings (as in they don't accept all ride requests given to them) and moderate to huge Cancellation Ratings (as in they cancel ride requests for varying reasons). These are your ""smart"" Uber drivers (and I'll explain in a bit why). ""Gold"" drivers are the ones with high Acceptance Ratings and low Cancellation Ratings. These drivers basically accept almost all rides and rarely cancel requests. ""Diamond"" drivers pretty much are near perfect when it comes to having extremely high Acceptance Ratings and almost non-existent cancellation ratings. The higher your rank, the more ""perks"" you get from your Uber Debit Card like 5% gas discounts and the like (which might turn into a credit card later). For Gold and Diamond drivers, they also get information on the general direction of where a ride request is going before they accept the ride, information that is not given to normal Pro drivers. So if that's the case, then why did I say the ""Pro"" drivers are the smart ones?

In order to make money with Uber, you have to be very picky about which ride requests you take. For example, if you are a Pro driver, you don't get information on the general direction a ride request is going when it pops up on your phone. What you see is where the request is coming from, how many miles it is away from you. For me personally (as well as other drivers), we accept ride requests that are just 3 miles away or less. Why? For each ride, you have a Minimum Fare (it's around $2.40). At 60 cents per mile and 20 cents per minute, you can earn $2.40 after around 3 or 4 miles of driving. If your ride request comes from 3 miles or 4 miles away, you pick up your passenger, and you find out that they're just traveling less than a mile away (or worse, just block away to the nearest liquor store), then you just wasted your gas, time, and money. You are NOT PAID while you're on your way to the passenger, so the 3 or 4 miles you drove to get to them doesn't count! In short, you drove 3 or 4 miles for this person, picked them up, and then dropped them off just a block away, and you only earned the minimum fare of $2.40 due to how short the trip was. Now let's see an alternate scenario. Let's say you received a ride request and it's just less than a mile away from you. Even if it's just a trip to the next block, you'll get the $2.40 minimum fare. So if we compare it, first trip example took a total of 3 or 4 miles plus an extra block to earn $2.40. In the second example, you only drove a total of less than 1 mile plus a block to earn $2.40. Second trip wins because you wasted less time, less gas.

Another way of making money as an Uber driver now is simply cancelling on passengers who don't show up on time in order to receive a Cancellation Fee ($3.75). Let's say you arrive at the spot on the gps that is where you're supposed to pick up your passenger. A timer shows up, usually 6 minutes in total, that you have to wait for the passenger. If they don't show up in that time, then you have the option of simply cancelling the ride to collect the Cancellation Fee. Drivers are not required to keep waiting on passengers who still haven't shown up after the time limit expires. Drivers who do that are just too kindhearted. If you notice nowadays, especially here in California, there are a lot more cancelled rides unlike before. Reason for this is that drivers have realized that there's no incentive for waiting on passengers beyond the time limit. Let me share my own personal experience. One time I was waiting on a passenger. The time limit already expired. Still, I thought I'd give the passenger an extra 5 minutes. Still no passenger, I even texted and called but there was no reply. Finally the passenger showed up. Guess how short the ride was? Just to two blocks down the road! I only earned $2.75 to $3.00 from that, most of the money came from the waiting time fee, which is just around 12 cents a minute.  Had I cancelled right after the time limit expired, then I would've had gotten MORE money, $3.75. 

There are a lot of other strategies on how to make money with Uber, most of them are dependent on your specific market. Different territory, different pay rates per mile/time, different features you can use, different population. 

Anyway go on UberPeople.net if you want to learn more about the problems of rideshare drivers. Don't be surprised if you find that majority of drivers hate Uber. I definitely don't have any loyalty to that company and the moment I have the opportunity to switch to another job, I'd abandon it faster than a warp speeding Enterprise.

Oh yeah, according to Uber, [""drivers aren't essential""](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/uber-drivers-ab5-tony-west-ride-share-business-california/), I think this will make people more understanding as to why Uber drivers feel the way they do towards the company."
1377,"I'm going to give the internet my secret to how I use and drive for Uber/Lyft.

I use it on my commute home using destination mode. I don't stay out late, change routes, or chase surges. I just flip on the app and make my way home. Here's how I justify it:

1. I'm already headed in the direction anyway, so my time and mileage is consider sunk cost.
2. The slight detour that I'll usually incur, which would be due to taking an early exit into a housing development that I would have otherwise driven right past is what I'll use to calculate $/hr revenue. On the days I get rides, it's $10-$15 for  every 10 minutes added to my drive home, that equates to an effective $60-$90/hr range. (I'll get to wear/tear, taxes)
3. I only do it on my way home. You never know how much of a detour the ride might take you. I don't have to be ""on-time"" in getting home. It is not worth it to be late to my job so I never do it on my way to work.
4. Most people requesting rides at 5pm rush hour are not the rowdy type pax stories you read about. They're just trying to get home too. I've had zero issues with passengers in the 3 years I've been doing this.
5. Weather and events: The trains are down? A conference in town? Surge rates bring my rate to 2x-3x what I usually make to $120-$180/hr. More than what I make at my desk.
6. This is my second favorite reason: I deduct the miles on my tax return. I like to look around and imagine I'm the only guy sitting in miserable traffic with the commute considered a taxable expense! Given that some days I get no rides, I actually filed a loss on my 2017 and 2018 taxes, further reducing my taxable income. Double win!
7. This is my favorite reason I driver for Uber: I get to chat about finances with strangers. I'm a 9-5 white collar professional pulling in 6 figs. I dress sharp, drive a nice/clean car. Naturally people are curious as to why I drive for uber. I subscribe to FIRE. I spread the word. As you can expect when I talk about this topic, it blows many people's minds. It's a 15-20 minute conversation between 2 strangers so I tell them everything: My story, my track to retire early, and how I'm doing it. This conversation not only helps pass the time, but it inspires many people. This usually turns into receiving a nice tip at the end of the ride. Some even ask if I'm single ;)"
1378,"I travel for work every week and have a pretty regular driver who takes me to the airports every week. I actually met him through Uber but switched to paying directly so he could avoid paying Uber a cut of his fare.

A little while back he told me he stopped driving for Uber entirely because they took advantage of both riders and drivers. I asked him how he meant and he brought up surge pricing. He said nowadays, drivers don't get the difference between normal price and surge price, they get a pitiful ""bonus"" instead while Uber pockets the rest.

Uber's entire justification for charging 2-4x as much for rides used to be that the drivers benefited and would be more likely to be available during peak hours. Now what's the justification? It just screws over riders and drivers alike."
1379,"A lot of the driving that I do for work is tax deductible.  I found that I tended to do much better on how much I got out of that deduction if I was either driving a super shitty car with almost no depreciation or a car with super high milage.  I would assume that the same would be true as a delivery driver for uber eats, doordash, or whatever.  

I got a car that pretty reliably gets \~45 mpg, so I end up spending around 5 cents/mile for actual gas.  The rest goes towards depreciation and whatever else.  At my tax bracket of 22%, the deduction ends up translating to about 12.6 cents/mile, so I get an extra 7 cents/mile or so to cover maintenance and whatever else."
1380,"Just to add to what is already being discussed, Uber and Lyft are losing money each and every year on their services, meaning not only is this side hustle probably not making you anything but it is likely unsustainable at current prices. 

A good side hustle should both make you income and be sustainable. Otherwise you are better off learning/doing something else with your time."
1381,"I'd argue that you're just wrong.

The federal mileage rate isn't really intended to represent actual cost.  It's a catch all number for tax deduction purposes.  It factors in more things than just gas or maintenance and a lot of those costs are fixed regardless of how many miles he drives.  It's not like he has to get another drivers license every time he picks up someone.  It also assumes a relatively new car which is important, considering he's driving a 10 year old Prius that is going to depreciate far less.

He's definitely not making $23/hour but he's definitely making money and able to deduct more on his taxes then he's actually spending on his car.  A general rule for all delivery people: Buy an old, cheap car."
1382,This is why I tip big every time. A $5 tip on a 30 minute ride more than doubles their earnings. And let’s face it: Lyft is *cheap* so you know you can afford to tip.
1383,">I thought about doing it as a side-gig, but the increase in insurance to include cover while driving for Uber/Lyft meant I'd have a high monthly minimum to just break even

It depends on what insurance you have. I have state farm and do Uber. A rideshare endorsement is an extra 5$ a month and covers me even if a rider is in the car and a wreck happens. I thought that was pretty fair."
1384,"I had a driver in LA once too. I remember his name was Max. He was talking about starting his own limousine company and had all these luxury car brochures. I asked him how long he had been working to build this limo company, he said like 13 years. He told me this story about LA having 17M people, the fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other. He said some guy got on the MTA here and dies. His corpse was doing laps around L.A. for 6 hours, people on and off sitting next to him. Nobody noticed."
1385,A Tahoe would be a UberXL or Black Car though right? Those are significantly higher fares if you can get them.
1386,"I bought a 1999 Corolla for $400 and freaking love it. It has all sorts of quirks but the A/C blows cold and the engine runs strong, and it has a relatively new clutch in it (oh yeah, it's a manual too). I work in a well-paid profession and some of the guys at work drive absurdly expensive vehicles. I saw an Aston Martin in the parking lot last Friday. Anyway my point is that if people looked at depreciation as a check they had to write each year, they'd make different choices when buying cars I think."
1387,"A while ago, I calculated my cost per mile over 3 years, including every penny of maintenance and repair. My old, trusty Volvo came in at a hair under $0.17/mile."
1388,"Not necessarily. A large car doesn't have to be an XL. For instance, during commuting hours, nobody probably needs an XL, so they will run as regulars."
1389,"Agree with everything you said except the last paragraph. A 3 day week, depending on the person you're asking, is incredible. I would work 2 20 hour days if it meant I got 5 days off (albeit the day after would essentially be a wash because I'd be dead tired). 

Any extra day off is an incredible utility for the average person, especially if you're talking about weekdays where like 65+% of industries are closed on the weekend (eye doctor I go to/PCP/etc.)"
1390,"It's also technically a *maximum* your employer isn't obligated to pay at that rate, though most do. 

I had a job where I frequently drove 400+ miles a month, which in the first car I had at the time (a 4-banger Impreza) was a good way to earn some extra money. It covered all of my expenses for the car, and most of the payment. 

Then I stopped driving that much for a couple of years and decided to go for a higher performance car (Golf R). Then suddenly the corporate shitheads I worked for started asking for 1000+ miles/month. Between maintenance costs, premium fuel, way lower mileage, etc. I would be *barely* breaking even at $.58 a mile all while destroying my own difficult to find car at a ridiculous rate.

It was actually one of the tipping points of me leaving the job. We were handing out company cars, or huge subsidies towards cars for managers and salespeople doing 500 miles a month. No matter what I argued and explained my manager just wanted  me to drive my car into the ground. A car isn't worth a job, but the principle of the company freely using up my property for their uses didn't settle well for me."
1391,"Bahahahaha.  A doctor I know once carefully remarked that it was amazing how hard the nurses worked to ensure that every crossword puzzle got completed that day.  Anyone who has stayed in a hospital likely has a story of a phenomenal nurse, and then the one who simply didn't give a shit.  My mom got spinal surgery and then got wounds from laying on hard pieces of medical equipment in bed.  They could have been simply moved!

That said, you can say ""X people don't work hard enough"" about many jobs (doctors, ahem).  Regardless of the stress, entry level nursing can be a road to a very cush NP position eventually, if someone wants."
1392,"Right, and then you feel like some kind of scumbag for not tipping at all. I just picked up this catered order for work. This was like a company event, 50 people. The bill was almost $700. The thing rang up with a default 18% tip as an easy select. Like over $100. I declined that and wrote in $20. A $20 tip for someone to put my food in boxes and hand it to me. Ludicrous."
1393,"This just sounds like you aren't a car person, and that's perfectly okay. For some people a car is just a tool to get them from point A to point B as safely and as comfortably as possible. For others it's something that they really enjoy--and having driven a variety of cars ranging from lower end sports cars to a 15 year old minivan, I can say that the difference is real. Buying a fun-to-drive higher end car is no different than taking up skiing or buying a small fishing boat: it's spending money on a hobby to enjoy in your free time, and is a totally fine choice as long as your budget supports it."
1394,"I mean what is there to scoff at? According to Android stats I usually average 6-8 hours a day doing various things on my phone. Work, personal, navigation, games... its used constantly. That makes it more used than my gaming PC, kitchen, mattress, my car... heck if you exclude sleeping I use it more than my apartment (which is more than a new iPhone, every month :( ).

It's close to 3 years old now (Google Pixel XL) and still runs great. I think it was $850 new. I also drop it frequently enough that I need a new otter box case about once a year... Never had it break, no screen scratches, nothing. It's solid, there's no bullshit, it just works. A phone is not a place to save money if you're going to use it."
1395,"I think that the gas being so cheap in the US makes people don't mind too much when buying old cars. A car from the 90s does about 3-9 Km/L when a car nowadays does like 12-14 Km/L, while a hybrid does 16-19 Km/L.

In the end, one is saving up in the car price, but expending almost the double in gas per Km/L (or mile per gallon)."
1396,"Yep. Fuck taxi businesses and fuck taxi drivers. As someone who's traveled a lot, the amount of bullshit they pull is unreal. Lying about distance, lying about bus times, lying about safety of other means of getting somewhere, changing the cost after the trip, not running the meter, hiding the meter, running the meter up intentionally by taking a longer route, pretending they don't have change and therefore you should just pay the difference, rejecting rides because of destination, upcharging tourists for a trip that locals have said has a standard price. Literally I've experienced each and every one of these personally, and this as someone who takes cabs as a last resort. F-U-C-K T-A-X-I-S."
1397,"A lot of 90s and 2000s cars here get similar mileage to new ones, for the same class of car. I find that newer cars tend to weigh more (safety stuff, mostly?) and those are the mileage and 'handling' gains.

I love my 2007 Focus. It has awesome visibility and handling. The newer ones are alright, but they have so much reinforcing in the back that the rear visibility is much worse, they drive like heavier cars, and instead of 27/37MPG, they get 30/40MPG."
1398,A lot of people who buy these phones pay monthly instead of paying $1100 at once. My last phone I think was $800 and I paid $27/month for it.
1399,"I blew close to $1k once, on the Note 9 . Technically, I jumped through some hoops and got the price down to $699 but had to shell out the $1k upfront and stare at it on my CC bill. I felt pretty freakin' dumb for like a month. Like, I expected $1k worth of fun of out my phone. Lol, nope. A phone is a phone. Gonna hang on to this until the wheels fall off :P ."
1400,"Yes and no.

As an owner, you'll still be responsible for maintaining the vehicle properly. Self driving cars will never eliminate that angle of liability, which exists even with respect to today's non-self-driving cars. If you don't maintain the brakes, and the car crashes because the brakes failed, it doesn't matter who was driving it.

However, when it comes to the car's autopilot system and its behavior while driving, the manufacturer is going to be responsible for that. A consumer would have zero control or input as to how that autopilot functions. The only way to pin liability on the owner of the vehicle is to make owners strictly liable for all decisions their cars make, and nobody's going to agree to that."

>can spend insane amounts of money on private transportation

Uhh..

 

Where the fuck was I when every single human being started being a part of this category? I'm so fucking jealous. Spent 10 years flipping burgers and finally landed myself a ""salary"" job fixing dishwashers at 25. A step up, sure, but I couldn't spend my rent on freaking Uber rides.. I just don't get it, I would be putting that money somewhere safe to buy a house.. god   "
1403,"Great idea!

I live in Vancouver, BC. A number of years ago I decided to get a bike instead of taking transit to work. I did some basic calculation a year later, and I ended up saving $800+ a year just on bus passes, and that was something like 4 yrs ago!"
1404,"A moped is also super convenient, although more costly with maintenance than a bike. I was averaging $250-300/mo on Lyft/Uber & now I spend much less. (approx $100)"
1405,"I didn't go far down into the thread and assume other people are saying this, but in the off-chance no one has said it: Public transportation in SF would be much cheaper than Uber/Lyft and is still convenient, and yes a bike is a great way to go. A Lyft/Uber every once in a while to supplement would still be much cheaper."
1406,A reaaallyy good lock. A $900 dollar bike is worth spending $50-100 plus dollars on a lock. 
1407,"or just make your own coffee.  A $7 bag of 12oz coffee you can usually get about ...20 cups, I am randomly guessing.  That is .35 cents a cup or so.  Instead of paying starbucks $2-5 per cup."
1408,"> otten an equally good bike for less than 300?

That is a good price for a middle of the road aluminum road bike. A dependable commuter. If you know your size you might score a used one cheaper with parts and TLC"
1409,"Don't worry. 

In the SF Bay Area, it wouldn't have mattered. A top of the line U-lock, plus bones, plus a cable, none of it actually works. 

And in my case, they didn't even leave the broken U-lock behind, so I couldn't even get the price of my bike reimbursed by U-lock's special guarantee that they'd pay for my bike if it got stolen (not that I placed much faith in that guarantee in the first place). 

The only thing that was left of my bike was my seat and that's because I would detach it each time and take it with me. 

Anyway, I hope the OP doesn't live in a place like the Bay Area. $900 is a lot to pay for every time his bike gets stolen. He should have found a used one for $30 at a police auction. It won't be pretty and it will barely work, but at least, when it gets stolen after a couple of weeks, he will only be out $30 plus any WD40 he had to soak it with to get it working."
1410,"Theres no point. If someone wants your bike any type of lock isnt going to stop them. You can get a portable grinder and drive around the city in a van all day long stealing bikes. A lock only prevents opportunity theft, theres no point in buying a good lock."
1411,"Hand held cutters won't touch that transport chain, but you can cut Grade 70 in less than 30 seconds with a 36"" pair of bolt cutters, and that's the sort of rig professional theives carry when they make night time visits to train stations, university bike stands, or what have you. They're probably more interested in the more expensive locked motorcycles, but if you leave a nice road bike it'll go too. A small, tight U lock + cable lock is the way to keep your bike in the city.     "
1412,"> To not notice that you are spending $750 a month to avoid public trans is crazy and shows this person has a shit ton of money to blow.

It really doesn't. A lot of people really are just this stupid. "
1413,"Even IF you get a residential parking pass, good luck finding parking. It sucks not wanting to drive your car because you know you wont find a parking spot when you get back. A car in SF is a nightmare if you dont have a guaranteed spot. "
1414,"This. So much. It's so important to lock the frame too. A new front wheel is much cheaper than to buy a new bike.

I used to only ""lock"" my bike using frame and front wheel. It even was in a secluded backyard (you couldn't see it from the street and even had to drive through a garage). 
No problems for a month or two and then suddenly my bike was gone one morning."
1415,A friend had a bike that sat in the outside for over a year. Ignition button wouldn't start it so I had to kick it for about an hour to warm it up. I gave up and got back to it the next day. After 30 minutes of kicking I got it to start. 11/10 best workout that week.
1416,"Way more fun, yes, but cheaper no. A POS car for close commutes can be had for under 2k, and, IMO, cars are way easier to work on than motorcycles if you can turn your own wrenches. Fuel consumption really isn't that big a difference these days; my last car was a civic with the cheap little motor in it, which got 32-37 mpg, compared to my fz6, which gets a conservative 45ish mpg, but more spirited commutes can drop that to like 36 or 37. They need a lot more preventative maintenance, and if you go to a mechanic make sure to bring lube. Tires on a car can go 50k for a few hundred bucks, whereas it's 350 for decent bike tires that last like 12k. Then again, you can't beat the smiles per miles factor."
1417,"A garage spot in most neighborhoods runs $250-300. A monthly parking pass downtown runs $250-400. Not saying what OP did is smart, but a car is definitely NOT the answer.

Source: own a car in SF. Pay $200 for parking on top of rent. Garages near work charge $300/month. Take Muni to work. "
1418,They're brazen as fuck!  A friend of mine had hers stolen off the Muni while at a stop light on Market. She immediately jumped off the bus and ran after him. Luckily some people saw her and helped her give chase. They ended up tackling the guy and she got her bike back.  
1419,"If you crash on a bike, your chances are much worse than if you were to crash in a car. The risks aren't even comparable. You can do everything right, and still fall victim to bad terrain, weather, or shit drivers (or a combination of the 3). I'd definitely want to see that statistic that says 90% of motorcycle crashes occur from your errors, because that sounds like bullshit to me. 

There's a simple joke that we tell in Russia: 

A man walks into an automotive dealership. He walks up to the dealer, and exclaims, ""Man, how many bikes did you sell last week?"" 

The dealer replies, ""Well, there was the three on Monday, four on Tuesday, and a couple on Thursday, so about ten I reckon.... Why do you ask?"" 

The morgue dude shakes his head, smiling, ""Only because we got about eight new arrivals to the morgue, I was wondering if business was slowing down for you!"" 

""Well, I'm sure they'll turn up next week!"" 

They shake hands and part ways. 

And then they all get fucked to death lol"
1420,"public transportation is dick where i am, and you're gonna find that in a lot of midwestern cities.  we're too sprawled out.  to and from work where i live would be a 45 minute bus ride and would dump me a mile from where i am.  our public transport is fine for very general parts of the city, but we aren't a municipality that has the means or the inclination to add a subway or rail.

biking is an option, since the trails do connect the major parts of the city, but you are talking sprawl to a massive degree here.  there's a huge difference in time getting places versus having a car.

in addition to that, buying a car isn't an investment, but it does secure safe and easy means of transport.  i don't want to wait 30 minutes for a bus when i could be there already.  in addition to that, the walk to my destination from the stop, grocery shopping, etc, is just handled better by cars--plus the busses stop running around 10 pm, so you have to plan around it.

having a family would be nigh impossible also.  between daycare and work hours, you're looking at an entire wasted day because you can't just go point A to point B directly.

i've no doubts that it can and does happen, but not having a car simply ISN'T economical for most people in cities that aren't major hubs or metropolises.

student debt is crippling people's futures.  cars have nothing to do with it."
1421,"Yes, the centre of London has congestion charge fees. Sadly, I am four miles away from central and the routes I would need to take for work do not stray into central. The A roads are okay, but the roundabouts connecting them are enough of a clusterfuck for cars never mind the cyclists. I see many experienced cyclists getting angry/confused and almost fall off."
1422,"Never said 90% was a statistic, it's just a generalization. 

I've been commuting on my motorcycle for 5 years, doing track days, race days, extra rider training in that time & of all the crashes I've heard of, most of them are the riders fault. 

I can picture one crash that *wasn't* the riders fault and he couldn't do anything. A bloke in an oncoming car had a heart attack while driving and suddenly hit the motorcyclist head on. He was luckily mostly fine except a fractured clavicle.

Yes, the risks on a motorcycle are more severe for consequences, but the fact is - risks considered, it comes down to the mentality of the rider. 

I've had several crashes, both on track & on road. I've ended up under a car and walked away without a scratch and just a bit of whiplash for a week. I've come off doing a wheelie at 146km/h and got road rash. I've come off doing 160km/h in a race trying to overtake and I ran out of tyre.  

I have taken responsibility for each of the crashes as mistakes I've made and use them to improve. 

Riders who end up as statistics are the ones who deny that there was anything they could've done and go out and make the same mistakes again. The mentality that ""It's not my fault, she cut me off"" makes the rider believe there is nothing they could've done. maybe instead of ""It's not my fault, she cut me off"" it could be seen as ""I was in her blind spot"" or if at a T-intersection you could say ""This car might pull out in front of me.. Let me adjust my road position so they can see me & prepare to stop if they pull out anyway"". 

Simple things like being able to slalom properly, efficiently and quickly to avoid hitting something is a skill many riders fail to remember in an emergency. I've seen videos of easily avoidable accidents on YouTube that riders would prefer to attempt to brake, rather than ride around. "
1423,"> e, too. An

The only reason i even bother with a bike lock at all is because i dont want some random person just figure; oh look an unlocked bike, I have been raised by gorillas so imma just take this bike to where im going then dump it in a ditch/river.

A bikelock will deter someone from joyriding or lifting your bike, but it wont even hinder a career criminal from taking it."
1424,"Yeah I know how that feels. A few weeks ago, i almost crashed into a car while he was backing up into the left lane from parking. I swerved to the right and the asshole went back to his parking spot. Luckily i was going at a speed where I could react fast enough."
1425,"Problem with today's ""social media"" is the tunnel vision it caters for people, a lot of people don't even read Reddit or other sources for more information. Click on some bitconnect videos and suddenly you'll find adds when you browse, suggested new videos, etc, generally all confirming what you think to know. A lot of people, unfortunately, don't see through this. You'd be surprised how gullible people are, especially when slowly being exposed to more of the same views that (start to) align with theirs. 

I agree it is their own fault, but perhaps in such cases we really need regulation to protect people against themselves.. I hope those responsible are held accountable though, because THEY did know and abused it. "
1426,"If you get the hyperlinks of the original videos they still might be archived on the Internet Wayback Machine. The video wont load but the title of it and anything in the description box might remain intact

A good rule of thumb I believe with YouTube ''crypto experts'' is to see if they regularly delist videos or live stream far more than uploading directly. To me that indicates a lack of accountability and hiding a trail should things not go there way. Some are more knowledgeable than others of course and a few offer information of actual value but still treat everything with a healthy degree of scepticism "
1427,"Oh yeah, there are many sheep out there, especially on YouTube. 

A week ago, I stumbled upon „The Crypto Chick“ on Youtube. Stunning looks, but truly retarded. Obviously she was spamming Reflinks left and right, plus endlessly shilling BitConnect.

If you haven't called yet, honestly, make it sound like your father is pretty much senile and had this set from when he was using it and since then hasn't touched a computer...we're ""taught"" that you use the terms of service and that you should be managing your finances so it really isn't up to AOL to monitor your usage or your finances.

They CAN do a credit back to the card, don't let them say otherwise, BUT DO NOT MENTION ANY LAWYERS...the minute you do that, they have to refer you to legal and the conversation stops. 

ALSO, DO NOT CANCEL THE ACCOUNT UNTIL AFTER A REFUND HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. If you do, it locks the CSR out of the account and you can't get anything back. You MIGHT be able to get a years worth of AOL refunded back to your card, but I wouldn't hope for much more.

Problem is the payment is delt through a credit company who won't let me cancel the payments and the insurance company has been bought / transferred over. So screw you legal general/Skipton and premium credit. So going to talk to my bank and get charges reversed and cancelled"
1439,"I see a lot of sometimes angry complaints about AOL as a service and how they handle cancellations etc., and as someone working with this daily I would like to provide a more exhaustive and informative point about how this actually works.


1. AOL is providing a service to you that are paying for. What you pay for, however, is the **access** to the service, not your ability to **use** it. To most people these two mean the same things, but they don't. To put it another way, when you subscribe and pay for Netflix, Netflix has no obligation to also provide you with an internet connection. This means that you can in theory pay for a Netflix account for an infinite amount of time without ever actually having to physically use it, because all you pay for is that they provide this particular service for you, so you can access it. But it is ultimately your responsibility as a customer to make sure that you can actually use it.


2. AOL has no obligation to inform you that you should cancel your subscription. The company are not mind readers and while a company can certainly fuck up, it is ultimately up to the customer to contact the company when they wish to cancel their subscription. This is because a company cannot know why you do not use their services anymore, assuming they are even able to track these things. 


3. In relation to 2.), this also means that a company has absolutely no obligation to refund you money once you notice that you've been paying for a service that you have not used for X years and did not cancel your subscription, because it is the customer's responsibility to know what they are paying for and if they do not want to pay, cancel that subscription. 


4. It is also the customer's responsibility to keep track of their bills including autopay services. A company cannot know whether you want to keep a service or not so if you use an autopay service and did not announce that you are going to cancel the account, obviously you will sent new bills that will be payed via the autopay service. This is exactly why I think people should *not* use autopay because while they are extremely comfortable to use, they provide very little control to the user and making changes can take a lot of effort and back and forth with your bank e.g. changing a price on a bill that is already being sent out. While I am on that point: no, unless the company *is* your bank, the company has no obligation to fix your bills for you in your bank and typically cannot even do that. That's because they do not have access to your bank account and you should not ask them to do that. Be smart. 


**tl;dr** it may sound terrible and heartless but it is always the customer's responsibility to have control over what they are paying for and to contact the company so they can cancel their subscription once they no longer need it. The company has certain cancellation rules that you agreed to when you signed the contract and those rules apply even if you failed to cancel your subscription 10 years after you stopped using the service. The company is adhering to the agreement as long as you have access to the service regardless of whether you are using it or not. It is not the company's fault that you've been billed for 10 years and you failed to announce them 10 years ago that you don't want to subscribe to their services anymore. 


Be a smart customer, read up on the agreements and what you sign up for and remember that while it sucks when you make mistakes that means the loss of money, your money is also your responsibility, no one else's, and companies have no obligation to babysit your financial expenses. 
"
1440,I've always been surprised that Aol is still a large company. This must be part of the reason - A reliable revenue stream from people that don't even know they're paying.
1441,"My advice is to take them to small claims court.

My father went through something similar with a defunct TiVo box, and there was no question it had been cancelled, but it kept billing and he didn't notice.

A customer service rep simply won't have the authorization to refund a large amount of money like that, you will have to go to small claims.

$3,600+ is a good amount of money, I wouldn't let it go.

Also, this is why it's a really good idea to switch credit card numbers every few years, you'd be amazed what still gets billed."
1442,"He budgets his money but never looks over his CC statement and cross references his budget?

Making a budget: don't spend over $X,000 a month isn't a super smart financial budget.

A budget is when you compare your expenses and income every month or two or few.

Not much of a budget..."
1443,A lot of services are automatically notified if a new credit card is issued. I noticed that when I went to update my CC info for Netflix and found they already had it in the system. Never rely on a new card being issued to result in a termination of service.
1444,"> I'm not sure when, but they changed the voltages in the phone exchanges when they went digital

At least in the USA, that is not the case. A regular phone-company landline is specified to provide enough power to ring the equivalent of *five* old-style Western Electric rotary phones per line.

1445,A campaign needs to be started to help remind people to cancel their aol accounts to put these fuckers out of business.
1446,"I'm in the same boat... I have 6 credits and 5500 reward points.  A couple of months ago I had just moved and didn't have the money for it after paying ~$3000 for deposit + rent, but we didn't have internet and the mobile site is too busy to pull up without wifi.  I called to skip the month and the automated system said I wasn't a VIP member and I couldn't skip it.  Sure enough a couple days later I got billed and had to call them and raise hell."
1447,"Depending on their collections process and the contract you signed, they may continue charging your account each month until you formally cancel it. And depending on their collections agency, they may bug the everloving shit out of you until you pay up.

The gym I will never return to required me to obtain a copy of my membership paper and include it with a handwritten letter stating that I wish to terminate the service, send it by priority mail, and that the cancellation process takes a month. They ended up charging me for two more months.

A second gym I considered signing up for assured me that I could cancel if need be just by calling them, just initial here. No thanks, learned my lesson with the last contract - theirs read the same. Handwritten letter, priority mail, long cancellation process. 

I just started buying my own equipment."
1448,"A renewal only changes the year.  I worked at a company with a subscription service years ago, and our billing software automatically increments the year whenever it fails billing.  "
1449,"A lot of banks do opt-in in a scummy way. 

 ""You'd like your credit card and info to be protected in case of theft, right?""

""Well, yes, of course"".

""Sure, we'll sign you up!""

""For the card?""

""Yes, and for your protection.""

""Um, thanks?""

""Is that a yes?""

""Yes, I guess so.""

""I need an affirmative answer"".

""Um.  Yes"".

That's how teenage me learned to distrust banks.

Later I learned that servers do the same thing...""do you want to try our BBQ sauce tonight?""  Then a 50c charge on the bill... that's not what ""try"" implies...

I did save 50c on that tip though!"
1450,I was just wondering about this yesterday. A girl I know posted about how she just discovered the subscriptions section of her apps on her phone. She was like “omg I was spending like $300 a month in apps I didn’t even know I signed up for” like how do you not realize that?! Do you never ever check your bank account/credit card statement. It is mind blowing to me! 
1451,"I got mine about a year or so ago.

It had a ton of very obvious prompts about it and it asked if I wanted it. It wasn't assumed or anything.

It was absolutely a ""Do you want this? No its really cool look... ok nevermind"" sort of thing. A little pushy but absolutely no assumption or opt-out. 

I would have to tick the box to opt in or ""Accept"" button or something. "
1452,"I would counter offer at 125% and not budge.  A consultant should make more than an employee; you have additional costs to bear.

No matter how badly I needed the money, my pride wouldn’t allow me to accept anything less."
1453,"I'm a freelancer, we're paid A LOT of money because employers can't offer us steady work.  Part of the trade off is that you get more money for less job security.

This should be the same idea here, but your boss wants to pay you LESS.  Kick him in the nuts (with your words of course)"
1454,"If you're doing consulting, you need to be paid more regardless of the company you work for. A business pays 30%-40% on top of an employee's salary for health care and other benefits, which is why consultants always seem to get paid more but actually don't.

You also are better than anyone they can hire, and you'd be losing unemployment. If you *like* your job, regardless of your shitty boss, ask for more than you used to make and point out that you're not interested otherwise because you really aren't. Why would you give up unemployment and lock in such a low salary? If you don't really like your job, don't give up unemployement to get screwed like this. "
1455,">Also after 4 months I cant get back on unemployment...

This can obviously vary between states but this is something I would verify before taking this to the bank. In many cases, taking on a temporary job doesn't restart your UI clock. It merely pauses the claim. 

Say you are entitled to benefits for 12 months, just for grins. You spend two months looking for work. Then you get a temp job. Any temp job, for three months. You go back out on that original claim and pick up at month 3. You don't start a fresh claim and have to meet the same eligibility. 

Again, varies between states.

That's a key question. Because if 60% of your pay is more than what UI is paying then this might be the best thing for you financially. It would also buy you some more time to find another opportunity as well as fill in some gaps on your resume. It will be easier for you to land a job while presently employed, even at half time, than from an unemployed state.

>having taken such a drastic pay cut I wouldn't be very well equipped to ask for more money in the future.

This isn't a pay cut. A pay cut would be you make $100k working 40 hours per week and they cut your pay to $90k for the same expectation of hours worked. You are being offered part-time hours at over half of your prior salary. I assume you likely worked more than a clean 40 and so the extra 10% is likely meant to reflect that. But this isn't a pay cut unless you go in there and begin working full time hours for part time pay. 

>I feel like this is a slap in the face and I want to counter offer their 60% slap with a 125% slap back.

While I get that you're feeling hurt from the layoff, you need to react to this offer, as well as any offer, untainted by emotion. This may be a way for you to buy some serious time and avoid spending savings while you look for a new job, to say nothing of how it will help your resume (hint: hiring managers view laid off employees who were hired back more favorably than employees who were just laid off). 

If you want revenge, buy a punching bad and put your boss's picture on it. This is a time for prudence and making your next career move."
1456,"A short term offer should be paying you MORE than your current preferred rate, not less! 

I personally wouldn't take a consulting stint for anything under 133% of my salary rate"
1457,"A consulting gig ... for less that the hourly?    
No - you're liable for all of the social security and medicare tax, not just the employee portion. Then there is any retirement/healthcare plans that you now need to take care of yourself."
1458,"Yep. I quit my job to stay home with the kids. A few months later, they needed me to work on a project for a few weeks. Asked for 150% of previous rate and got it without any haggling. "

Definite upvote!


A buddy of mine did this. He started contracting with the company he used to work for after they let him go as a full time employee. He set up a S-corp (or LLC; not sure which), negotiated to work on their project for 15 hours a week, then obtaibed other contracts doing the similar stuff with other companies. Now, he's killing it and making way more than if he stayed with the original company."
1460,I quit my job last year because I was unhappy with it. A couple months later they asked me to come back for a 3 month contract because my replacement was about to go on maternity leave. I asked for 30% higher hourly rate and got it. Didn't know it was normal to ask for 1.5X or 2X...damn. Now I know for the future! Thanks for the info!
1461,"A million times this.

Company that laid me off has asked for help on stuff I built.  I told them $500/hr with a 4hr minimum, and I am open to retainers.  No retainer yet, but Christmas was amazing! ;)"
1462,"I've seen it for 25 years -- the average work who thinks they're working hard for 8 hours is likely putting in about 3 hours of work and 5 hours of non-work.

If you can squash 40 hours of work into 16, you can do it.

It's hard to see it from the employee's side, but every consultant reading this knows exactly what I'm talking about.

Having the same job for 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year puts you into a comfort and complacency zone.  It's human nature.  It's why relationships get boring so quickly.  We get comfortable and complacent and stop working out and start eating more Doritos on the couch.

Same with work.

A consultant is always a single bachelor."
1463,"And you know, I'll happily pay your Dad the $2000 that he asks for. A shittily done level 5 finish looks atrocious and is absolutely useless. It still needs to be redone completely."
1464,"Yeah, everybody's giving good advice I'm sure. OP should follow it. But OP should also be ready for a whole lot of no thank you when they come back from the lowball offer with a super highball offer involving a bunch of terms and conditions in their favor. 

It sounds like OP has been unemployed for 3 months, job searching that entire time. A good poker player bluffs, but it doesn't sound like OP is in a strong bargaining position. Already employed by another company and needing to justify leaving that new job would be strong. 3 months unemployed with probably a house payment, kids, spouse, health insurance costs, etc, etc, is not strong. "
1465,"I am a UK based contractor, and the terms may be different, but, you can have a rolling contract or a fixed price contract.  A rolling contract will keep on going with a minimum / maximum hours per week and as long as they still want you, you keep turning up and invoicing the time.  A fixed price contract would be to complete a set block of work within a specified time limit.  Once that work is complete, you are done.  Before you sign the contract you look at the scope of work and the timescales and determine yourself if the work can be done in the time.  If not, you amend the contract and everyone agrees, or you walk away.

Source: UK based contractor for 21+ years."
1466,"I'm a consultant at a consulting firm, and we write up an SOW (Statement of Work) and have it signed by the client and ourselves as a sort of contract of expectations. Within, there's the explanation of the project and why it's necessary, a general timeline and key deliverable deadlines, and - very importantly - a list of expectations that are necessary for on-time delivery of the project.

This section is really important, it's typically a bullet-point list of the requirements to finish the project on time. Stuff like ""Client SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) will be available to answer questions and test the application throughout development"", ""A Development environment will be made available throughout the course of the project and team members will be given appropriate permissions to access and update the environment as-needed"". Etc.

This way, if you get 15 days into the project and realize that Bob had planned vacation during the last 5 days of the project, and that this will affect the timeline, you can point to the SOW and explain that this interference was why there was a delay. Or maybe the client had problems with the IT infrastructure and it corrupted the work already done, which extends the timeline of the project.

But, to your point, there's only so much this can cover. Part of being a consultant - particularly an independent consultant in charge of writing up these contracts and getting project approval - is appropriately estimating work and giving yourself enough time in the contract to get the work done on time. There are all sorts of tricks that consulting companies use (And that I, personally, hate) to underbid on projects but sign contracts with adequate budgets/timelines. 

Yes, absolutely reasonable to question your consultants if they go over the allotted budget or timeline. But as a consultant, there are some protections you can put in place to make sure 5 hours over doesn't become a lawsuit."
1467,"And, each short term contract MUST be considered with the clear fact that:

- you don't get paid vacations
- you don't get overtime
- you don't get any holiday pay, or even holidays
- at the end of the contract, unless EXTREMELY lucky -- you won't be instantly employed

A person working 3, 3 month contracts per year is often the norm, with 1 month to find a new contract each time.

Meaning, just from that alone?  33% more should be charged.

Then, work out 260+ days paid as an employee, and 230 days or so paid as a contractor, when you take off holiday pay and the like.  Then add what everyone else said above in, and yes -- even 2x isn't enough sometimes..."
1468,A guy that makes regular deliveries at my facility used to drive tanker trucks in Iraq as a private contractor. He transported oil or gas just like you would see in the US. But he got paid an absolute shit ton because it was a combat zone. He was making like $250k per year and only working 8 months out of the year.

Most Co-op students and interns we hire, even third and fourth year students, don't know anything. A couple months experience is transformative.

Our jobs aren't that hard as long as you have an aptitude for problem solving (essentially math, logic and reasoning) and you can pick up the ""tools"" of the particular job quickly.

1472,"It is! We tell that to them, because 100% of the time they ask us to rewrite it and not just edit, because they don't want to do the work themselves.

And it turns out Saudi people and Saudi schools don't care. And based on the quality of their theses, they don't deserve the degrees. Meanwhile, they're going to graduate anyway, so might as well get a piece of the $$$ pie.

It's not unethical to them in their society, so it's not unethical to me. Would you put the translators name on your thesis if you paid for translation? Maybe. A lot of my work is a lot like translation, only its gibberish english to actual English. But for Western standards, probably unethical."
1473,"A lot of careers are like that. I am currently an IT Sys Admin and spent $65k getting a bachelor's degree in IT Info Systems. Great on paper and has helped me get in the door of the last 2 jobs I've had since college, but the experience and projects you gain over time mean *way* more on a resume than some piece of paper a school gave you. In fact I bet I could have the same position without that degree and instead more internships and certifications. Makes me wish I'd have realized this before going off to college; Would have saved a lot of money and been in this career at a much earlier age and likely in a better overall financial position. Unfortunately society and high schools drill it into our children's minds that College is the *only* path to success. Reality is, it's not. "

My boyfriend is constantly checking his phone, talking about buying lambos but is still inviting me to McDonald's.

A friend of mine who's into crypto told me he's likely something called a wojak or a doomer. I don't get much what's going on but I want to try to save our relationship.

I decided to bring him to his senses by letting him meet my father who's into real finance. Things didn't go so well between them.

We're in a worse place now and I can not stand his mood swings anymore. Is there anything else I can do? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
